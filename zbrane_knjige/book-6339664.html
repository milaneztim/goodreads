She's never been particularly attracted to the boys at her school, no matter how hard her best friend, Vee, pushes them at her. Not until Patch comes along. With his easy smile and eyes that seem to see inside her, Patch draws Nora to him against her better judgment.<br /><br />But after a series of terrifying encounters, Nora's not sure whom to trust. Patch seems to be everywhere she is and seems to know more about her than her closest friends. She can't decide whether she should fall into his arms or run and hide. And when she tries to seek some answers, she finds herself near a truth that is way more unsettling than anything Patch makes her feel.<br /><br />For she is right in the middle of an ancient battle between the immortal and those that have fallen - and, when it comes to choosing sides, the wrong choice will cost Nora her life.</span>

Your love and passion for this project are humbling! With that said, I have some movie news to share. Unfortunately it may not be the news you've been waiting to hear. I have decided that now is not the right time to move forward with the Hush, Hush movie and have not renewed the movie option with LD Entertainment. I know many of you will be disappointed by this. But I hope that you trust me to make the right decision for Nora and Patch. I'm not saying the movie will never happen, but it won’t be moving forward at this time.<br /><br /> Thanks again,<br /> Becca<a class="jsHide hideAction" href="#">(less)</a></span></span>

  <span id="freeText11397443237336258720" style="display:none">NOW WITH SPOILERY RANT @ BOTTOM!<br /><br /><b>Hush, Hush</b> is the story of Nora Grey, an average high school student going about her business as usual -- until her Biology teacher rearranges the class seating and places her next to the dangerous-looking new kid, Patch Cipriano.  Nora gets a weird feeling from Patch, and things just keep going from bad to worse as Nora becomes convinced that she is being stalked, and may even be the target of murderous intentions.  Add to the list Nora's strange feelings about the Archangel ride at the amusement park and her constant near death experiences, and well, Nora's life is becoming anything but average.<br /><br />When I finished reading <b>Hush, Hush</b>, I had to mull it over for awhile.  I really wasn't sure what to say.  I am absolutely enthralled by the cover (athletic looking, darkly mysterious fallen angel, contorted in mid-air in grayscale?  What's not to like?).  I <i>had</i> to have it because of that cover*.  But I had a sneaking suspicion that a cover that good had to be masking something.  Yep.  It's a bright light to dazzle the eyes and make you *ahem* overlook any faults.<br />It didn't work.<br /><br />Inside was the most confused, schizophrenic piece of writing I've read in some time.  Becca Fitzpatrick didn't seem to know <i>quite</i> what she wanted, only that it had to be Ominous and Scary and Dangerous -- and Titillating, of course, and Mysterious and Sexy.  So with those buzz words in mind, she threw a bunch of things together and let her narrator, Nora, sort them out. Nora, understandably, had some trouble with this, and the result is a thoroughly frustrating heroine who jumps to insane conclusions based on inane evidence one moment, and the next goes blithely along into obvious danger.<br /><br />Patch is intriguing, and perhaps the most consistent character**, and I was fully prepared for an 'anti-hero as the hero' story.  I wanted a little boundary-pushing and a not entirely likeable or trustworthy male lead who may or may not redeem himself, but who gives you the dangerous and alluring in spades.  For the most part, Patch wasn't a let-down in this regard, and as screwed up as it is to like him, he was the stand-out character for me. (Not to say I didn't have issues with him, too.)<br /><br />But it wasn't enough.  Patch's bad boy antics couldn't save this book from itself.  It was self-indulgent, cheesy, melodramatic in the worst sense, and confusing. I wanted to like it; I loved the fallen angel premise, the idea of an anti-hero, and bits and pieces of the writing throughout.  But <b>Hush, Hush</b> suffered from too many villains and too much shock and awe, and not enough thought and follow-through.  Maybe Fitzpatrick can pull it together for round two, and with some strong convincing by trusted, like-minded people,<s> I may be willing to give her another chance </s> (never gonna happen). But this was a monstrous let-down for me.  You've been warned.***<br /><br /><br />*We all know how that whole so-pretty-I-just-had-to thing works out.  See my <a href="http://onceuponabookcase.blogspot.com/2010/02/guest-post-from-misty-of-book-rat.html" rel="nofollow noopener">guest post</a> on Jo's blog about this.<br />**And by 'consistent' I mean he was consistently a douche. Vee was pretty consistent too, and was a lot of fun, but she started to get annoying and a little strange... <br />***You're still going to read it, aren't you?  Damn you, James Porto and your beautiful, beautiful cover!<br /><br />***HERE THAR BE SPOILERS***<br /><br />If you haven't read Hush, Hush and intend to, or if you don't want me dissing the melodrama that is Patch and Nora, look away....NOW!<br /><br /><br />Commence rant:<br /><br /><br />You already know I had issues with this book. I think a lot of people are going to take offense to the idea of Patch as the hero, as teen girls' fantasy, just as they did with Edward in Twilight. Patch goes beyond the simple term "bad boy" in that yes, he does actually mean Nora harm. Consistently.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into that, because frankly, I don't care. He can be an anti-hero all he wants, whatever. If that's where the story's going, fine. Most of my issues -- but not all -- lie with Nora.<br /><br />Here's the thing:<br /><br />Nora is that girl you yell at in the horror movie, the idiot that goes up the stairs instead of out the door, or reaches to turn over the downed bad guy <i>just to make sure</i>. We all know that's frustrating, but we've come to expect it in movies, and that dumb big-breasted, scantily clad girl normally gets killed off.<br /><br />Nora is so much more frustrating than that. <br /><br /><b>The many sides of Nora</b>: She continually suspects Patch (and Elliot, and just about everyone else in this story), and with good reason. However, she then continually ignores her instincts and puts herself in danger. In fact, she can't seem to agree with herself. She will think to herself that Patch is stalking her and trying to kill her, and then within pages think 'Oh, but he could never hurt me.' This just cycles and cycles throughout the story.<br /><br />Also throughout the story, Nora makes insane jumps in logic -- whether they turn out to be true or not, it's not believable when she immediately jumps to the most bizarre conclusions <u>and then acts on them</u>. At the same time, she will be directly confronted with some piece of real evidence, something that would make a normal, non-fictional person take notice and say something's not right here -- and she will completely ignore it. It's like she's being willfully obtuse.<br /><br />Examples:<br /><br /> * Early(ish) in the story, Nora hears a voice in her head and thinks Patch has "breached normal communication methods and could, at will, speak to me without ever opening his mouth." Naturally, she thinks she's delusional. Hearing your name and a few inane comments would make one think they are imagining things, and this I could buy. Even Nora not being exactly sure what happened and being creeped out I could buy. <b> But she proceeds to ask Patch how he's able to speak directly to her mind</b>, making her look like a loon. <br />I wouldn't be even all that bothered by this, if it was consistent throughout the story; if Nora either consistently thought that she was going crazy because of all the implausible things that are happening, I could buy it; if she wanted to prove she wasn't crazy and kept confronting Patch and sleuthing, I could buy it. It would be 1 solid choice on Becca Fitzpatrick's part. She could be the ultra-paranoid girl who thinks she's going crazy and jumps to conclusions about everything. Annoying, but doable. But to present this as if it's normal...and I'm out.<br /><br /> * Conversely, near the near the end of the story when the shit's really beginning to go down and nearly everyone has become a villain, Nora and Patch walk out of a movie theater to find that "...both the tires on the driver's side were flat: '"I can't believe it!" I said. "I drove over two nails?"' <br /> <br />O_O <br />??? <br /><br />She thinks she's being stalked, she thinks her best friend has been kidnapped by a teenaged murderer named Elliot, and by this point she thinks she's the target of not one but two murderous angels, and yet all she can come up with is that she ran over two nails? Come on! If Nora will jump to conclusions on the barest of evidence, how in hell does she not comprehend the obvious? <br /><br /> * Throughout the story, Nora thinks everyone's out to get her (she's right, but I'll get to that), especially Patch. Patch is Ominous, capital 'O', and yet...And yet, no matter how much Nora thinks he's badbadbad, she trusts him. Why? <br />Weirdest of all, when Nora confronts Patch about his intentions, <b>
  <u>he admits he wanted to kill her</u>
</b>; her reaction? 'I know Patch could never hurt me' -- and she trusts him implicitly from that point on. Really? The whole story, you've suspected him and been insistent that you should stay away on the barest of evidence, but once he's confessed his (albeit previous) intentions of murder, you trust him. <b>
  <i>Really</i>
</b>. Her sudden bizarre trust of Patch comes too late for any real belief in their romance. Or her sanity.<br /><br />There is no consistency in Nora's thinking. I just can't understand why Becca Fitzpatrick couldn't pick one Nora to write and stick with her. <br />She could have just always thought she was losing her mind; self-doubt would have been interesting, and made her root-forable. <br />If she had just been reckless and always convinced that yes, maybe something is a little off about Patch, but she still found herself attracted to him, it would have been interesting, and could have been used to slowly reveal the truth and up Nora's anxiety. <br />If Nora had just been naive and always convinced that everything was fine despite any indicators, it would have built tension. <br />But combining it all made Nora seem confused and a little off herself, and made the writing seem schizophrenic. <br /><br /><br /><b>Too many villains</b>: Fitzpatrick makes the rookie mistake of lack of restraint. Nora suspects everyone, and everyone does in fact seem to be a villain. This makes the book seem unfocused and sort of cheesy. When everyone is under suspicion, and everyone seems to be a bad guy, it makes it seem like no one really is. It's like if you use a really great word once or twice it's going to stand out. But if every word you use is some great, unusual word, none are going to stand out. There's no negative space, no background to make the focal point pop. Everywhere Nora turns, someone's trying to kill her. It just gets silly after awhile. Also, it has the added negative effect of making it hard for Fitzpatrick to "top" as it were. Where does she go from here? If there are 4 different people trying to kill Nora in book 1, how many people will there be out for blood in book 2? She didn't leave any room to grow the suspense.<br /><br />Another bad thing about the amount of villains and Nora's instant suspicion (and the overall over-the-top nature of the book) was that there was precious little suspense. By giving everything away rather freely, Fitzpatrick deprived the reader of the slow build-up and the privilege of the mystery; we never got to have any suspicions of our own, or choose sides. There was too much in the way of ominous overtones, and not enough restraint.<br /><br />On a side note, not that I'm calling Vee a villain, but even she became a little weird* as the story went on. It's one thing to be the wild and crazy girl in the best friends dynamic, but constantly trying to get your best friend alone with a guy who she says makes her uncomfortable, who she believes broke into her house and may be stalking her, and who she knows was a murder suspect is reckless beyond the pale, and shitty, shitty friendship.<br /><br />*By which I mean she goes from being quirky and funny to a godawful, shitty friend. You know, for no other reason than apparently to help lure Nora into bad/ridiculous situations. Plot device: ☑<br /><br /><b>The writing overall</b>: I saw glimpses in Fitzpatrick's writing that demonstrated how this could have been a good book. She does sexual tension and confrontation scenes fairly well, and there is some good humor. Vee -- in the beginning, at least, before she becomes a really reckless, really bad friend -- was pretty amusing as the traditional sidekick. Patch had great one-liners, both funny and smoldering. <br />But for all the occasional good, there was quite a bit in the way of bad. The dialogue was often stilted and weird. The analogies were completely out of left field. They were those turns of phrase that you can tell were used because they sounded cool, or because one was needed, but they don't mean anything, or they leave you thinking wtf? "His eyes looked like they didn't play by the rules." What does that even mean? What rules do eyes usually play by? Does he not blink? This is a mild example, but I got sick of making note of them. I got this really hit-and-miss feel about the writing and the language in the book. Pieces of literary crap mixed in with the really good bits blended to form a "throw it all in and something's bound to work" style. A total lack of finesse made it hard to want to keep reading -- and made me feel like if I kept rolling my eyeballs, they were going to roll right out of my head.<br /><br /><br />Rant complete.</span>

Writ­ing a novel is hard work and is some­thing I have never done and I cer­tainly don’t think I could do a bet­ter job. I am sim­ply, with light-hearted inten­tion, using humour and imag­i­na­tion to spark book dis­cus­sion and fun and point out some issues I had with the novel.<br /><br />And lastly, please don’t sue me. I have no money. And I have chil­dren to feed. And I have a cat to feed as well. You wouldn’t want a cat to go with­out food, would you? Also, pretty please with a cherry on top. I’ll be your friend?*<br /> <br /><br /><i>I was backed up against the counter, my palms dig­ging into the edge. “You’re mad because I didn’t go to Del­phic.” I raised one shaky shoul­der. “Why Del­phic, Patch? It’s Sun­day night. Del­phic will be clos­ing soon. Any spe­cial rea­son you wanted me to drive to a dark, soon-to-be deserted amuse­ment park?”<br /><br />He walked toward me until he was stand­ing close enough that I could see his black eyes beneath his ball cap.<br /><br />“Dabria told me you have to sac­ri­fice me to get a human body,” I said.<br /><br />Patch was quiet a moment. “And you think I’d go through with it?”<br /><br />I swal­lowed. “Then it’s true?”<br /><br />Our eyes locked. “It has to be an inten­tional sac­ri­fice. Sim­ply killing you won’t do it.”<br /><br />“Are you the only per­son who can do this to me?”<br /><br />“No, but I’m prob­a­bly the only per­son who knows the end result, and the only per­son who would attempt it. It’s the rea­son I came to school. I had to get close to you. I needed you. It’s the rea­son I walked into your life.”<br /><br />I looked at him for a moment, his intense gaze shoot­ing through me as I con­sid­ered the infor­ma­tion he’d just confirmed.</i><br /><br />“Okay,” I said, straight­en­ing up and slip­ping out from his over­bear­ing pres­ence to put some space between us.<br /><br />“Okay?”<br /><br />“Okay, I’m out of here.”<br /><br />“You can’t go!” Patch said, his face twist­ing into a con­fused expression.<br /><br />“Well, you’ve pretty much admit­ted that you were going to kill me, in a very per­sonal way, might I add. I think that jus­ti­fies a quick and hasty exit,” I spat at him, straight­en­ing my out­fit in indig­na­tion and stand­ing up to him with more con­fi­dence than I felt.<br /><br />Patch splut­tered for a moment, blink­ing his eyes dis­be­liev­ingly. “But… I wasn’t… I mean…” he looked lost for a moment before vis­i­bly col­lect­ing him­self and slip­ping back into his usual, con­fi­dent demeanor. <i>“You want me to come clean, I will. I’ll tell you every­thing. Who I am and what I’ve done. Every last detail. I’ll dig it all up, but you have to ask. You have to want it. You can see who I was, or you can see who I am now. I’m not good,” he said, pierc­ing me with eyes that absorbed all light but reflected none, “but I was worse.”</i><br /><br />I arched an eye­brow and stared at him in dis­be­lief. “Well, I have a dif­fer­ent plan, Patch. Mainly revolv­ing around the fact that you pur­posely entered my life in order to stalk, harass and mur­der me for your nefar­i­ous schemes. So I think this would be a pretty good time for you to quit the mys­te­ri­ous bull­shit and be extremely trans­par­ent about every­thing I need to know. I mean, you haven’t even assured me, at this point, that you’re not actu­ally going to kill me. And I don’t mean to harp on this point – but that’s a pretty impor­tant facet of this dis­cus­sion for me.”<br /><br />He stalked close to me again, affect­ing a brood­ing, intense expres­sion and caus­ing my heart to thud painfully in my chest. <i>His boots were flush with the toes of my ten­nis shoes. “I’m not going to kill you, Nora. I don’t kill peo­ple who are impor­tant to me. And you top the list.”</i><br /><br />I exerted con­sid­er­able effort to con­tain an eye­roll, but it slipped through at the last minute. <i>“You’re imping­ing on my pri­vate space,” I said, inch­ing back­ward</i> in dis­taste.<br /><br /><i>Patch gave a barely-there smile. “Imping­ing? This isn’t the SAT, Nora.”</i><br /><br />I pressed my finger-tips to his chest. He glanced at the spot where we touched and then back up to my eyes. “If my vocab­u­lary is caus­ing you dis­tress,” I whis­pered huskily, look­ing up to him with a wicked smile on my face, “then let me express my dis­plea­sure in the only way you seem to understand.”<br /><br />Patch’s brow creased in con­fu­sion a moment before my heel came down hard on his instep. He hopped back in pain, look­ing at me with both hurt and bewil­der­ment. “Per­sonal bound­aries, Patch. Respect them when I ask you to. See, I have this rule about let­ting would-be mur­der­ers within ten feet of my very stab-able body. Now, tell me. Is Dabria going to be com­ing after me.”<br /><br />Patch, mirac­u­lously less inter­ested in encroach­ing on my per­sonal space, shrugged from where he was. <i>“You could take her, Angel,” he said. “I’ve seen both of you in action,”</i> he looked down at his injured foot and winked, <i>“and my bet’s on you. You don’t need me for that.”</i><br /><br />“I don’t think I need you for much of any­thing,” I sneered, turn­ing on him and head­ing to the door.<br /><br /><i>“Door’s locked,” he said</i> from behind me. <i>“And we have unfin­ished business.”</i><br /><br />“Lis­ten, the only unfin­ished busi­ness we have is between my knee and your crotch if you come near me again.”<br /><br /><i>The cell phone in my pocket rang to life.</i> “In fact,” I said as I pulled it out, “you’re going to go away and I don’t ever, EVER want to see your broody, mopey face again. You have for­ever cured me of bad­boys. When this is over, it’s strictly account­ing nerds and bank­ing types for me! This was absolutely the WORST way to pun­ish my mother for her absence, assert my inde­pen­dence and act out my grief from los­ing my father. I should have just stolen money from my mother’s purse and bought alco­hol like a NORMAL teenager!” I pressed the accept but­ton on my cell. “What?!”<br /><br /><i>“Babe!” Vee said. We had a bad con­nec­tion, the crack­led of sta­tic cut­ting across her voice. “Where are you?”<br /><br />“Where are you? Are you still with Elliot and Jules?” I flat­tened a hand against my free ear to hear better.<br /><br />“I’m at school. We broke in,” she said in a voice that was naughty to per­fec­tion. “We want to play hide-and-seek but don’t have enough peo­ple for two teams. So… do you know of a fourth per­son who could come play with us?”<br /><br />An inco­her­ent voice mum­bled in the background.<br /><br />“Elliot wants me to tell you that if you don’t come be his part­ner –hang on- what?” Vee said into the background.<br /><br />Elliot’s voice came on. “Nora? Come play with us. Oth­er­wise, there’s a tree in the com­mon area with Vee’s name on it.”</i><br /><br />I groaned in dis­be­lief and promised myself that if I sur­vived this, I’d choose friends who weren’t com­plete and utter dumbasses.<br /><br /><i>“Who was that?” Patch asked.</i><br /><br />I sighed heav­ily. “That was my brain­less, drop­kick friend phon­ing me to pass along the mes­sage that Elliot and Jules are going to mur­der her vio­lently unless I go meet up with them.”<br /><br />“What was that you were say­ing about never again see­ing my broody, mop­ing face?” Patch asked, his con­fi­dence returned tri­fold and an enor­mous grin spread across his face.<br /><br />I resisted the urge to smash my face into the tiled wall repeat­edly. “Oh, shut up and come on. I’ll prob­a­bly end up nobly sac­ri­fic­ing myself and sav­ing your ass any­way, so cut the shit, Patch.”<br /><br />He unlocked and opened the door, let­ting me out ahead of him.<br /><br />“Still going to set­tle for an accoun­tant or banker?”<br /><br />“You had bet­ter be so damn awe­some in bed or I am going to stab you through the eye with your own lit­er­al­ized ego.”<br /><br />“I have ninety-nine prob­lems, Nora, but per­for­mance in the sack is NOT one of them.”<br /><br />The end.<br /><br /></span>

REALLY?</i> Because it doesn't just cross the line into the <b>uncomfortably creepy territory</b> - it takes a cosmic leap over it.<br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380375805i/730465.jpg" width="400" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br><br><i>Hush, Hush</i> may have the dubious distinction of being the worst book I've ever read. <i>(I assumed it's a book since that's what you'd call a bunch of printed and bound pages, but I'm really applying the term 'book' loosely here).</i> Yes, I know I'm not the intended audience, <b>but should terribly written books that can only aspire to reach the same literary heights as the word-of-the-day toilet paper even HAVE a target audience???</b> Yes, I'm being harsh. But I'm also being honest. Let me give you a sample of my complaints (all of them would be longer than the allowed review space).<blockquote>This book reads as though someone read <i>Twilight</i>, appreciated the obviously marketable and profitable premise, and decided to rewrite it in an "edgier" way - which boiled down to clumsily asking a question, <i>"What did Twilight lack?"</i> and coming up with the answer, <b>"Sexual creepiness bordering on sexual harrassment. That's it. LLLLLLadies."</b>
</blockquote>Meet Nora Grey, an 'average' high-schooler who meets a mysterious boy Patch in biology. <b>By the way, my (future hypothetical) daughter will not be allowed to take high school biology since that's where all potential supernatural creeps appear to lurk, looking for gullible teenage-girl prey.</b> The boy acts like a total jerk to her, and his sleazy innuendos are alarming and appalling but not charming or witty or sexy. The natural things to do would be: <b>(a)</b> tell him off, <b>(b)</b> tell the school officials, and <b>(c)</b> call the police if the d-bag does not stop harrassing you. Instead, Nora Grey decides to madly fall in love with the jerk. (*)<blockquote>* Dear teenage girls! <b>"He hates me - therefore it means he loves me" approach does not work in real life.</b> While we're at it - <i>PEOPLE WANTING TO KILL YOU IS NOT SEXY EITHER</i>. Dear YA authors, please stop perpetuating this idiocy. </blockquote>Patch is a fallen angel (no spoilers, it was stated on page one or so) with a dark past. But basically he is an entitled arrogant jerk who appears to take immense pleasure in publicly humiliating Nora, physically forcing himself on her, physically intimidating her, ignoring her wishes, and gloating in his dripping douchebaggery approach while nearly sexually assaulting her in front of the class. <b><i>“I make you uneasy?”</i> he asks. The proper answer would be to scream, "YES! NOW BACK AWAY!!!!"</b><br><br>**<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380375805i/730466.jpg" width="350" height="200" class="gr-hostedUserImg"> **<br><br>But for some inexplicable reason Nora is in love with the creep. For some inexplicable reason, his appalling behavior is presented as alluring and seductive. For some inexplicable reason, he is presented as a "dark and dangerous" man of every girl's dream. <b>WHYYYYYYYYYYY????? Oh nevermind, here's the answer:</b><blockquote> <i>"Yes, actually, he had that effect on me. He also had the tendency to wipe all logical thought from my mind."<br>"My brain couldn’t process one logical thought."</i>
</blockquote>This may explain why we get pages and pages of this incoherent lovestruck bumbling masquerading as a book! Mystery solved, my job here is done.<br>**********************************<br><br>While I'm on the soapbox, let me say this - <b>STALKING IS NOT SEXY. STALKING IS NOT OKAY. STALKING IS NOT LOVE. VIOLATING PRIVACY IS NOT LOVE EITHER and should result in a restraining order </b> You see, our wonderful Nora thinks it's perfectly okay to learn about the mysterious new boy by breaking into the students' records office to look at the confidential file (<i>she does it by calling in a bomb threat - which is (a) awful, (b) promptly forgotten about and never followed up on</i>), and spying at him at work, snooping for information from his coworkers. I hate the message this book is sending.<br><br>***********************************<br><b>I hate punctuation abuse. It's innocent, so stop torturing it.</b> Please... leave... the... faux-dramatic-pause ... ellipses ... in ... your... fanfiction... please. Unless you're paid for each ellipsis used. End... the... ellipses... abuse...<br>... ... ... ... <img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380375805i/730467.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="gr-hostedUserImg">... ... ... ... <p>***************************<br><b>What is up with the sloppy writing that assumes describing small insignificant and frankly boring details adds anything to the story?</b> Why am I subjected to the endless details of what exactly the characters are ordering in a Mexican restaurant, what the specials are, and how long it takes a waitress to bring the order? Why should I care? Why do I need to know the details of the bra design that the girls are shopping for? How exactly does that enrich the story? Please stop the filler. It's awful.<br>*****************************<br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380375805i/730468.jpg" width="400" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br><br>Hey, what with not having the slightest trust in the readers' ability to figure things out? What's with the dropping of <b>anvil-sized hints</b> every few pages? What happened to simple foreshadowing? Patch's identity, the villain's identity, Nora's identity - we can figure it out without the author SCREAMING hints into our faces. Really. Trust me.<br>*****************************<br>But in the end, despite the awfulness, I cannot be upset at Nora - mainly because I'm really worried about that girl's health. Here's why:</p><blockquote>
  <i>"My heart fumbled a beat [...]"<br>"My heartbeat turned erratic, and I told myself to pull it together."<br>"My heart did an unexpected flip, startled by his bizarrely attractive smile."</i>
</blockquote>Nora, you know what you need instead of a creepy boyfriend? <b>A cardiology consult.</b> Your heart sounds unhealthy to me.<br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380375805i/730469.jpg" width="400" height="80" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br>-----------------------------------<br>Terrible book with lackluster annoying characters, ridiculous plot, and bad writing, but with overabundance of creepiness. <b>1 star</b> because that's the lowest rating I can give. Reading it was a miserable experience.<br>-----------<br>4.0 rating on Goodreads? Really? Sometimes I really wonder whether I'm reading the same book as everyone else.</span>

  <span id="freeText12622415049183253677" style="display:none"><b>Top Ten Irrational Points in <i>hush, hush</i> </b><br /><br /><b>Nora’s sex ed class</b> begins with the teacher stating, “Human reproduction…requires mature handling. And like all science, the best approach is to learn by sleuthing. For the rest of the class, practice this technique by finding out as much as you can about your new (seating assignment) partner. Tomorrow, bring your write-up of your discoveries, and believe me, I’m going to check for authenticity…I want to see real interaction and teamwork.” This is a <i>biology</i> class! Teaching kids how to get to know one another reflects the teaching of the science of human reproduction <i>how????</i> The next day, class focuses on what qualities each student looks for in a “potential mate” and the nuances of body language when hitting on someone. Again, this is Bio! Not health, not ~ well I don’t know what cause I never took a class this ridiculous. But I took a lot of sciences, and this ain’t it. <br /><br />Later on in the book,<b> the Bio class is “running a lab on blood pressure.”</b> Uh… that has nothing to do with high school biology! And even less to do with human reproduction. WTF? Furthermore, in the blood pressure lab, “Vee is lying faceup on a table.” Argh! Those lab tables are <i>filthy</i>. Chemicals, dissections… kids are not allowed to sit on them, much less lay on them. And, really unless you are checking orthostatic BP, there is really no need to lie down for five minutes before hand! All I can say is that Becca Fitzpatrick must have been homeschooled. <br /><br />Later, Nora approaches her Bio teacher about switching her seat away from Patch because he makes her feel uncomfortable. <b> The teacher not only ignores her plea, but enlists her to tutor Patch.</b> This all takes place right after Patch is seriously sexually harassing Nora in class, in front of the teacher and seemingly with the teacher’s encouragement. More support for the homeschooled theory!<br /><br />Nora is driving home one night, and approaches a traffic light. The light turns yellow and Nora, <b>”…rolled to a stop, checked to see that traffic was clear, then pulled into the intersection.”</b> What the hell? Who stops at a yellow light to see if traffic is clear?? Why wouldn’t it be when the other side still has a red light? I’m guessing that Fitzpatrick has never owned a driver’s license. Ever. <br /><br />A rollercoaster called <b>The Archangel</b>. Do people at a park really give a crap about biblical lore? Furthermore, the car Nora &amp; Patch ride in has a “grouping of four paintings” depicting an angels’ fall from grace. Don’t all rollercoasters have large flashy graphics that can be seen from a distance &amp; look cool when speeding around the track? Since when do they sport fairly intricate and thoughtful artwork? <br /><br /><b>A local paper reported that Elliot Saunders, a 16yr old kid, was the last person to be seen with a girl before her body was found, and therefore was held &amp; questioned for her murder. </b> So, in addition to being a non-driving, homeschooled, amusement park avoider… Fitzpatrick is clearly unaware of laws protecting minors in this country. <br /><br />The article continues to state that Elliot was released after a suicide note was found in the victim’s apartment. There are no further news stories regarding this matter. Nevertheless, <b>Nora persists in believing that there is a “murder investigation surrounding Elliot.”</b> And this girl has hopes of getting into an Ivy league school???? <br /><br />Nora has the police at her house for a 911 call, and again to question her about an attack on a fellow student. <b>Nora’s mother is never informed of the police visits, despite the fact that Nora is a minor.</b> I shouldn’t be surprised, because it has already been established that Fitzpatrick has no understanding of laws pertaining to minors. <br /><br />Nora sees Patch’s bare back and notices that, <b>”Two thick gashes ran the length of it. They started near his kidneys, and ended at his shoulder blades, widening to form an upside down V.”</b> Is it just me?!?! If an <i>upside down V extends from the kidneys to the shoulder blades, it will NARROW not widen!!!!!</i> Right? Fitzpatrick could have written that the gashes started at his shoulder blades, and extended to his kidneys as they widened to form an upside down V. But the way it’s written? It doesn’t make sense! Furthermore, the kidneys are pretty much right below the shoulder blades, not further out from them. Yeah, I’m nitpicking. <br /><br />The final irrational aspect of <i>hush, hush</i> is <b>Nora herself</b> .She is naïve, spineless, and a horrible and chronic liar. When she doesn’t want to do something, she will make up lame excuse after lame excuse… even when she gets called out for her excuses, she never has the balls to simply say, “I am not interested in having dinner/date/whatever with you.” She just continues to make up excuses ~ never comes clean or sticks up for herself. When Patch is attempting to corner &amp; kiss her, Nora tells him to go. When he doesn’t, she says, “My legs are falling asleep” What? Who says that?! Lord, if you want him to go and he doesn’t then TELL HIM AGAIN! BUT DON’T MAKE UP SOME LAME ASS EXCUSE! No wonder people walk all over Nora and take advantage of her! Nora is so frightened of Patch, that there is even a scene where he is playing cat and mouse with her ~ chasing her around a parked car, until she breaks out in a run, only to be caught by him in a matter of seconds. But despite her fear, she never tells him NO. <br /><br />I don’t take issue with Patch. Really. He is thousands of years old (presumably), isn’t human, and for some reason has developed a crush on a very immature teen. So I actually expect him to mess with her a little bit. But dumbass Nora actually <i>allows</i> him to manipulate her. Not that she deserves it (although, really she does!) but Nora does nothing to defend herself against Patch, Elliot, Vee… anyone! She loses control of every conversation and interaction she participates in. And still manages to come out the “heroine.” Whatever! Had Nora grown or changed as a result of her experiences, I could have forgiven her. Or if Nora had suffered some severe consequences as a result of her stupidity, I could have forgiven Fitzpatrick. As it is…I’m considering destroying this library book and facing the repurcussions of a library black mark (or god forbid ban!) all in the name of saving young, impressionable teen girls from thinking Nora is the sort of protagonist to look up to. Even Bella Swan is more admirable. And that’s saying something!<br /></span>

I can't say I didn't like it. Yeah I know it has some mistakes or nonsense things but it was good. It was similar to Twilight, and if you know me you would know that I truly hate that series, but it was a good similar, a better one. For me at least. Also the book cover is one of the best covers ever. It's so creative and the colors are perfectly collided.</p><br><br>____________________________________________<br><blockquote>“Say 'provoking' again.

I can't say that it was unique. The story was quite predicted, like I could tell what will happen but for me it was a fun read and I seriously think that this book would have been better if it didn't have angels at all.</p><br><br>____________________________________________<br><blockquote>“You're a guardian angel now." I was still too much in awe to wrap my mind around it, but at the same time I felt amazement, curiosity...happiness.<br><br>"I'm your guardian angel," he said.<br><br>"I get my very own guardian angel? What, exactly, is your job description?"<br><br>"Guard your body." His smile tipped higher. "I take my job seriously, which means I'm going to need to get acquainted with the subject matter on a personal level.” </blockquote><br>____________________________________________<br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1417219939i/12262306.jpg" width="400" height="350" alt="description" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br><br><p>I can't say<i> the plot</i> was rich. It was random, but good random and I did like the background of scenes, like BO Arcade is such a cool place and I had a pretty awesome picture of it in my mind. Also the school scene at the end was hilarious, like the gym and classes. And the farmhouse was quite creepy, it reminded me the ring movie and I don't know why, maybe the fog, but it was cool and well thought.</p><br><br>____________________________________________<br><blockquote>“All this time I've hated myself for it. I thought I'd given it up for nothing. But if I hadn't fallen, I wouldn't have met you.” </blockquote><br>____________________________________________<br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1417219939i/12262307._SY540_.png" width="400" height="450" alt="description" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br><br><p><b><i>The beginning</i></b> was good, also the middle but the ending was great. My favorite scene was the light out school scene. It reminded me a scene from 'Teen Wolf' the TV series. It was greatly described and that was the only moment I didn't know what was going to happen, even though it ended fast.</p><br><br>____________________________________________<br><blockquote>“Cheshvan starts tonight," Rixon said, "What are you doing arsing around in a graveyard?"<br><br>"Thinking."<br><br>"Thinking?"<br><br>"A process by which I use my brain to make a rational decision.” </blockquote><br>____________________________________________<br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1417219939i/12262308.png" width="400" height="200" alt="description" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br><br><p><b><i>The writing style</i></b> is not bad but it is not great either.

One day the Couch decides to change their seats for a project and she gets to sit with Patch, a boy who rarely talked. At the first words they exchanged she felt something new inside her. She couldn't stand him because of his arrogance but also couldn't deny the feelings. Also things started to happen, new things, new people, new troubles in her life. She felt the need to learn more, more about Patch, but was she ready to know?</p><br><br>____________________________________________<br><blockquote>“Before I forget, here's your homework.

  <i>I <b>recommend</b> this book if you are into creepy paranormal romance. It doesn't have role model or give a positive message but it is a fun read, especially for this time of year. I enjoyed it:)</i>

  <span id="freeText12088755753188201765" style="display:none">This book is simply appalling. <br /><br />I won't lie, my expectations going in about this book were pretty low. But even so, "Hush, Hush" managed to disappoint me.<br /><br />First, there are many similarities with "Twilight" - you have a regular average girl here, absent parents, a love affair with a dangerous supernatural boyfriend, a final showdown with a villain of his own kind. The mythology, while somewhat unusual (I haven't read anything about fallen angels in YA so far), is paper thin. The characters are shallow and undeveloped (BTW, Vee is the dumbest character I've read about maybe ever). <br /><br />But this is not even what makes this book a barely tolerable read. This book is just plain silly, and silly not in a cute-and-funny way, but more in it's-pretty-dumb-and-dangerous-to-fall-for-this-crap way. Many things are just so contrived about the story, I got a headache rolling my eyes while reading it. For instance: a bomb threat to steal an empty personal file that nobody investigates later? a biology class which is centered on discussing one uncomfortable and almost harassed student's sexual attractiveness? why would a mother whose husband was murdered leave her 16-year old daughter alone in a remote house for weeks at a time? why would parents of another teenage girl let her go out NEXT DAY after she had surgery following a violent attack on her? dressing up like a hooker to get some dirt on a guy you are investigating? why would an angel fall for loving a human and then get his wings back while loving another human? <br /><br />And finally, why exactly Patch and Nora are in love? They know nothing about each other. Even more, Nora spends most of the book calling Patch creepy, being scared of him, being roughly pinned by him to various walls in dark places or being at his knife's point, and yet she is full of desire for him? It just makes no sense. As for Patch, I don't know one thing about him or why he loves Nora. My list can go on and on...<br /><br />But surely enough, teenage girls will eat this story up. You have everything for success here: a fabulous cover and font, and pages and pages of flirtatious banter filled with sexual innuendos (very often bordering on sexual harassment) fit for 30-year olds and not 10-graders.<br /><br />I am rarely for any kind of censorship of books, but reading nonsense like "Hush, Hush" makes me wonder: what are these writers thinking? In my opinion, YA writers should be held to a higher standard than your usual writers of adults fiction. Why would they want to promote such outright disturbing relationships as normal to impressionable and silly teenage girls? In my book, the relationship between Patch and Nora is not simply shallow, but dangerous. I wish some of the authors exercised better judgment writing their books, otherwise they are setting up many-many girls for a lot of disappointment, because whatever is presented in this book as romantic is disturbing at best in real life. <br /><br />Well, to sum this tirade up, "Hush, Hush" is pretty much a book that gives YA literature a bad name. Naturally, the sequel is in works, but surely enough, I won't be reading it. I'd rather dedicate my time to something better written and less contrived and misguided.<br /><br />Reading challenge: #1 - F</span>

Please read them, especially if you don’t like the word feminist, especially if you think Patch is ‘hot’ or ‘romantic’, and especially if you’re thinking about trolling this review. Learn what’s really acceptable before you bash someone for saying Patch isn’t. It seemed so often that the only reason Nora was saying no to Patch was so that she could later relent, thereby confirming the fact that when women say no they really mean yes, especially to hot guys they’re attracted to and frightened of at the same time.<br><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380359923ra/710839.gif" width="500" height="267" alt="description" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br><br>Oh, Ms Fitzpatrick, you’re a crafty one. But 30 pages of non-shittiness at the end of a 400 page book can’t redeem all the shittiness from the earlier pages.<br><br>So, here’s what happens in this book.<br>Nora: Some creepy transfer student is sexually harassing me.<br>Patch: LOL, you know you want me.<br>Nora: Fuck off, creep.<br>Elliot: Hi Nora, I’m the complete opposite of Patch, and I’m your only alternative.<br>Nora: I better go out with you so I don’t think about Patch.<br>Patch: Come leave your perfectly normal date and ride on a rollercoaster with me even though you hate me.<br>Nora: Okay.<br>New school counsellor: Stay away from Patch<br>Nora: Okay. But he’s following me anyway so I better confront him.<br>Patch: You’re so sexy I want to bone you. /<b>threatens rape</b>/<br>Nora: Even though you just threatened to rape me, I’m going to accept a ride home with you because I’m pathetic and I can’t call my mum or a cab or catch a bus.<br>Patch: Wielding a knife makes me sexy and I’m going to almost kiss you.<br>Nora: Fuck off. You terrify me.<br>Patch: Loosen up, babe. You love it. By the way, I was planning on killing you. /<b>sexual assault</b>/<br>Nora: You’re right, I do love it /<b>facenoms</b>/<br><br>I have to credit Fitzpatrick for her red herrings. I wasn’t sure who to trust or who the antagonist really was until it was revealed. So kudos to her for that. And the other thing I have to say is that Fitzpatrick actually seems to have a grasp of the English language. It’s not her writing technique that I hate, it’s the characters and their attitudes and the messages hidden in this book that disgust me. Fitzpatrick’s clearly written her own teenage fantasy here: to be sexually assaulted by a hot guy who’s so hot the sexual assault is forgiven because the girl really wants it but just pretends she doesn’t to preserve her feminine modesty. Although – I must remind everyone – this book would have had at least five different editors to help her get the basics of grammar and punctuation correct. Also – she’s not afraid of writing fight scenes, unlike several other YA PNR authors who build up and build up and threaten with a war and then fizzle out with nothing.<br><br>I was beyond prepared for this book. I still believe that it should not have been published because it glorifies rape culture, the women are complete bitches and the blokes are complete twats. I read this book with my trusty Post It notes beside me and marked the page every time I found something, offensive, stupid, or downright shitty:<br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380359923i/710840._SX540_.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="description" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br><i>Um… if I write something about all of these tags, this review will probably take forever… SIGH. Okay, I’ll do it.</i><br><a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[<br><blockquote>Coach continued, “Since the dawn of time, women have been attracted to mates with strong survival skills—like intelligence and physical prowess—because men with these qualities are more likely to bring home dinner at the end of the day.”</blockquote>
<br>What about lesbians? Seriously. Do lesbians even exist in this world? This is so fucking sexist it makes me want to vomit. This is around the time Nora’s being openly sexually harassed in the classroom, which pisses me off. I won’t go into how stupid it is that a sports coach is teaching biology, because there are plenty of other reviews that delve into that (yes, some sports teachers do have degrees in biology blah blah blah but it’s not very common and this Coach doesn’t know anything about reproduction: he thinks it means the students have to find a mate RIGHT NOW). This entire class revolves around how women want strong men to protect them and bring home the bacon and men want attractive women because ugly women don’t get laid. Which is pretty funny, because the two biggest slags in my city are both ugly as fuck yet between them have slept with nearly every male I know. I also have to mention that if Patch wasn’t a hottie patottie, there is no way anyone would support all that sexual harassment to Nora. Coach laughs it off because Nora’s being a hysterical woman: a man showing unwanted sexual attraction is a <i>compliment</i>, and nothing to get all worked up about – besides, the point of the class was to teach those strapping young lads when a girl is aroused. Stop having a woman’s period and suck up the fact that a guy wants to bone you. In fact, maybe you should spend more time with him and his unwelcome sexual advances. In fact, Nora should tutor Patch! (Which, actually, is only mentioned once more in the entire novel.) I was pretty offended by this whole thing. <br><br><blockquote>As little as I knew about [Patch], I sensed his aversion to Vee as if it were concrete enough to touch.”</blockquote>
<br>Patch has never met Vee. How can Nora know how he would feel about her best friend? Fitzpatrick is very desperately trying to show us here that Nora is the only thing Patch is interested in, even more than her ‘sexy’ non-virginal best friend.<br><br><blockquote>I took a moment to think over his offer. I was pretty sure that if I turned Elliot down, Vee would kill me. Besides, going out with Elliot seemed like a good way to escape my uncomfortable attraction to Patch.</blockquote>
<br>So you want to go out with Elliot not because you like him or he’s nice or you want to get to know him better, but because your best friend will kill you if you say no and you think it’ll help you get over Patch? What a bitch!<br><br><blockquote> “Every woman needs to reinvent her sexy side—I like that. My daughter got implants. She said she did it for herself, but what woman gets boobs for herself? They are a burden. She got the boobs for a man.”</blockquote>
<br>Please excuse me while I let my inner feminist rant and rage about how sexist and demeaning that is.<br><br><blockquote>“Boys like girls who look like … girls.”</blockquote>
<br>Fuck you, Vee, and your anti-feminist agenda! Girls do not need to dress up to impress boys! Some boys like other boys! Some boys like girls with a bit of meat on them! Some boys like petite dark girls while others like Scandinavian Amazons! What right have YOU to say what girls should look like? My whole young adult life I was taught that the right boys will like you for you, not what you look like! What were you taught? That spreading your legs is the only way to get a guy’s attention?<br><br><blockquote>I dug in my heels. “You want to help? Stay away from me.”<br>He brushed a curl off my face. “Love the hair. Love when it’s out of control. It’s like seeing a side of you that needs to come out more often.”</blockquote>
<br>Every time Nora tells him to fuck off, he comes back with a compliment on her physical appearance that’s loaded with innuendo. This reinforces the rape culture of the book. Nora’s saying no, but she’s being reasonably polite and Patch is ignoring her rejections.<br><br><blockquote>“You sound worked up. Really worked up. No, that’s not it. You sound agitated … flustered … aroused.” I could feel her eyes widen. “He kissed you, didn’t he?”</blockquote>
<br>What the fuck, Vee? First of all, it’s none of your business. Second of all, kisses do not always lead to arousal. Third, it’s none of your fucking business. Fourth, how the fuck do you tell if someone is aroused over the phone? Fifth, it is <i>none of your fucking business</i>. And sixth: how do you know when your best friend is aroused when she’s never been around anyone she’s found attractive before? Did you two watch porn together one time? Do you discuss what makes you horny and how your voices sound when that happens? Or are you secretly in love with Nora?<br><br><blockquote>Every other time I’d felt that way, it was because Patch was near.<br>The voice of reason quickly extinguished Patch’s involvement.</blockquote>
<br>If <i>every other time</i> you’d felt that way, Patch was involved, how can you logically rule out his involvement? How does this literally work? How does your brain work, Nora? “When I’d punched myself in the face it hurt. But the voice of reason told me my face didn’t hurt because I’d punched it.” MALARKY! Cause and effect. Causation and correlation. Fucking dumbass. How the hell are you fit for an Ivy-league school?<br><br><blockquote> “You’re an attractive girl. I imagine there must be some interest from the opposite sex.”</blockquote>
<br>This counts as sexual harassment from yet another adult. How is this appropriate? Yes, I do know who Miss Greene turns out to be but still, if my councillor asked me this question I’d put in a formal fucking complaint.<br><br><blockquote>Not one part of me felt comfortable with the idea of Vee spending time alone with Jules… [because he] was close friends with Elliot.</blockquote>
<br>Oh Nora, you are so fucking lucky people don’t judge you because of who you hang around with you shallow fucking bitch.<br><br><blockquote> In fact, I was pretty sure Australia had no diamonds. Period.</blockquote>
<br><a href="http://www.costellos.com.au/diamonds/industry.html&lt;br%20/&gt;" rel="nofollow noopener"> BAHAHAHAHAHA!<br></a> And you think you deserve an Ivy-league scholarship?<br><br><blockquote>Deep inside, I didn’t believe Patch was the guy behind the ski mask. Maybe he had dark, disturbing secrets, but running around in a ski mask wasn’t one of them.</blockquote>
<br>How the fuck do you know? You don’t know him at all! Or maybe it’s just because he’s so hot that he couldn’t possibly attack you – except the he does! Over and over and over again! Nora, you really are fucking stupid.<br><br><blockquote>“We need to ask you both a few questions,” he continued. He pointed for me to take a seat on my bed, but I shook my head numbly. “Have you recently broken up with a boyfriend?”</blockquote>
<br>Fuck! Why are all the adults so interested in Nora’s romantic/sex life? This is not normal. She’s sixteen. Adults prefer to pretend sixteen year olds don’t have sex at all.<br><br><blockquote>“I’m sorry, but <i>Elliot</i>? A murderer? He’s, like, the nicest guy I’ve ever met.”</blockquote>
<br>And you, Vee Sky, are the most selfish, ignorant, stupid bitchiest dumbass characters I’ve ever read in the history of YA.<br><br><blockquote>I was feeling a lot more relaxed. Patch was warm and solid, and he smelled fantastic. Like mint and rich, dark earth. Nobody had jumped out at us on the ride home... For the first time all day I felt safe.<br>Except that Patch had cornered me in a dark tunnel and was possibly stalking me. Maybe not so safe.</blockquote>
<br>This is an actual quote. It’s like Nora’ schizophrenic or something. “Patch is SO hot, except he might be stalking me and I’m not safe and he’s SO dangerous, but that just makes him even hotter!” I have never in my whole life ever known a girl to find a guy she’s afraid of attractive.<br><br><blockquote>“When I was in high school, I only offered rides to girls I was interested in. Let’s carry that a step further. What’s your relationship with your bio partner … outside the classroom?”</blockquote>
<br>Yet another example of all the adults’ inappropriate interest in Nora’s sexuality, sexual history, romantic life and sex life.<br><br><blockquote>I could not accept that Patch would hurt Marcie. Marcie wasn’t the nicest person, and she’d acquired more than a handful of enemies. A few of those enemies might be capable of brutality, but Patch wasn’t one of them. Senseless beating wasn’t his style.</blockquote>
<br>WHAT?! It’s EXACTLY his style. He’s a creepy stalker who sexually harasses and assaults you (and you LIKE it, you crazy bitch) and then you get all up on your high horse because you think he’s too good to beat someone up? YOU DON’T EVEN KNOW HIM.<br><br><blockquote>“Sorry, I already have plans.”<br>“Let me change your mind.”</blockquote>
<br>Yet another one of the very numerous examples where a male assumes Nora’s very definite ‘no’ means ‘take me, I’m yours’.<br><br><blockquote>“He dragged me out the front door and shoved me against the house.”<br>“But he was drunk, right?”</blockquote>
<br>Ladies and gentlefolk: Vee Sky! Official worst best friend ever. Defending a guy she doesn’t even know against assaulting her best friend because he’s drunk. Oh, well that’s okay then! Maybe if Elliot happened to be driving drunk and killed a toddler and its mother because he ran onto the pavement Vee would forgive him as well, because he has issues and was drunk!<br><br><blockquote>He leaned close and spoke in confidential tones. “We get a lot of folks who don’t want their extracurricular activities traced, if you know what I mean.”</blockquote>
<br>Yet ANOTHER example of an inappropriate comment made by an adult to a minor! What planet is Fitzpatrick from?<br><br><blockquote>My head spun faster, and I could feel my pulse beating in my temples. I’d felt this heart pounding panic before. I needed my iron pills.</blockquote>
<br>All this malarky with the iron pills. Nora has anaemia. She has to take iron pills or she’s in danger of, like, fainting… or something. <i>Prescription</i> iron pills. This is complete bullshit. <b>I have anaemia</b>. I buy my iron tablets off the shelf. If I forget to take them, I get a bit lethargic, tired, lose energy and concentration, and as a personal side effect my lips get very dry, broken and unkissable (which is why I always use lip balm). There is only danger of fainting from low iron if it’s chronically low, and Nora doesn’t show any other symptoms like shortness of breath, lethargy, chest pain, palpitations, fatigue, or cold skin. It’s not even essential that I take my iron tablets, and I certainly don’t feel the lowness of iron in my blood the way experienced diabetics can feel low blood sugar. Anaemia is not going to kill me if I forget to take a couple of tablets: it’s simply inconvenient. Fitzpatrick has given Nora an inconvenient ‘illness’ in the hopes that it makes her weak in her time of greatest need. And it fails. (And now, just because I’m being especially picky: iron tablets are best taken with vitamin C which helps to absorb it, not ‘whenever I feel like the iron count in my blood is low’. Which, by the way, we totally can’t tell.)<br><br><blockquote>In the kitchen I saw my bottle of iron pills on the counter, and I immediately went for them, popping the cap and swallowing two with a glass of chocolate milk. I stood in place a moment, letting the iron work into my system, feeling my breathing deepen and slow.</blockquote>
<br>What the fuck? Just what the actual fuck? You can’t feel the iron working its way into your blood. Just NO. That’s NOT how it works. You don’t feel any different at all. This is complete bullshit.<br><br><blockquote>Jules was dead. Elliot was almost dead. Who had killed them? Who was left? I tried to make sense of what was happening, but all reason had left me.</blockquote>
<br>Nora, you never had any reason. Let’s think about this. Jules is dead. Elliot is almost dead. Only Patch and Vee are still wandering the school. Logically it’s gotta be one of them. Unless it was secretly you. Why can’t you just admit that you think Patch is capable of this violence? Look, I know Jules is screwing with you, but really. You can’t even consider for one moment that maybe Patch, the psycho stalking sexual harasser and assaulter is responsible for such violence? Cos the moment you outright accuse him and then find out he’s not would be AWESOME.<br><br><blockquote>All the knots in my body seemed to come undone. My eyes moved out of focus. Jules’s face was like an Impressionist painting—blurred around the edges, lacking detail. Blood drained from my head, and I felt myself start to slip off the chair. I’d felt this way enough times before to know I needed iron. Soon.</blockquote>
<br>That has <i>never</i> happened to me, and I have gone weeks without taking any iron supplements. You know what? This book makes me want to punch <i>myself</i> in the face. Nora should be diabetic, not anaemic. One of my best mates is diabetic and when she was learning to read her own body she’d do stuff like that on the way to a coma from low blood sugar. (We made her drink this special glucose syrupy thing and she was fine, BTW. We’re not horrible friends who just let our best mate go into a coma before our eyes.) Iron does not magically fix the body when you think you’re going to faint.<br><br><blockquote>“I’m still in there, a prisoner inside <i>my own body</i>, living every moment of it,” he said in a grinding tone. “Do you know what that feels like? <i>Do you</i>?” <b>he shouted.</b>
</blockquote>

Tacked on to the end like a bad apology. Although Fitzpatrick had generally a fine technique, I’m inclined to believe that came about solely because of the multitude of edits this book would have gone through. And they missed this clumsy piece of writing. I absolutely hate it when authors write, “Blah blah blah,” he said. “Blah blah?” he shouted. It just doesn’t work. For the love of god, I’d prefer a bloody interrobang to an extra dialogue tag. This may be one of the only times I have an issue with Fitzpatrick’s technique, but it still bothers me.<br> <a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br>I don’t <i>really</i> want to try Crescendo but I’m going to… the only problem I have before reading is that the books go from Hush, Hush to Crescendo to Silence. Now, first of all I have no idea why this book is called Hush, Hush. Unless it’s telling women who complain about unwanted sexual attention to shut up. But to get from hushing to silence you need a <i>diminuendo</i>, not a crescendo. I suppose once I read it I’ll be able to comment on how appropriate the title is.<br><br>You know what’s kept 'hush hush'? Sexual assault.<br><br>I just had an epiphany. Maybe Ms Fitzpatrick is really trolling us all because she knows she’s written a book about sexual harassment and ironically named it Hush, Hush.<br><br>No, wait. That would be giving her more credit than she deserves.</["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></span>

But, in my own humble opinion, Hush Hush is a far superior book. Yes this book has a few faults (the bad guy is far too easy to figure out, and there are a few continuity issues that pop up), but they obviously didn't bother me that much since i basically read this book in one sitting.<br /> <br />And finally, let me just say this...Patch is one helluva hero. He's a full-on sexy badass, and I loved him to pieces.<br /><br />Here's hoping November comes quickly, so i can devour the 2nd book in the series. </span>

  <span id="freeText11978623489434350860" style="display:none">I have forty eight sticky notes.<br />Well, forty nine, I suppose, since I use the little white backing thing too. They're quite nice sticky notes, designed not to be written on but as bookmarks; at some year in the past they magically appeared in my Christmas stocking, and I haven't really used them since. I suspect there were originally fifty, so I've used two elsewhere.<br />Anyhow. Forty nine sticky notes was what I started with when I commenced reading Hush, Hush a little after 9 AM on August 25.<br />Less than fifteen hours and over a hundred pages later, I ran out of sticky notes. I used the notes to mark particularly horrendous parts of the book- and frankly, I'm surprised they lasted this long.<br />In the interest of not broaching another set of sticky notes which I may want from school, I'm going to deal with this book segment by segment; when I finish one round of sticky notes, I review and then continue. 'Course, since I won't post this until it's finished you'll just get the complete version. No perspective analysis, unless I really feel like it. All I'm going to do is quote Fitzpatrick, comment on the quote briefly, and move on.<br /><br />EDIT: Before I even got through Section 1, I was over Goodreads' character limit by 978 characters. I still have more than 9 pages (counting one side of a sheet of lined paper as a page) of handwritten notes to type up- and those aren't even including responses, they're just quotes. So I'm going to cut this review down to the maximum accepted size (and do some formatting too) and post the rest in comments. Lengthy ranting? Heck yes.<br /><br />Section 1: 0-113<br /><br />Chauncey was with a farmer's daughter on the grassy banks of the Loire River when the storm rolled in, and having let his gelding wander in the meadow, was left to his own two feet to carry him back to the chateau. <br /> <br />- Book begins, very first sentence, with sex. BAD SIGN.<br />-Is this going to be relevant? Do the doings of one randy duke in Sixteenth Century France really concern the later plot?<br /><br /><br />Kneeling there, blinking up through the rain, he saw two thick scars on the back of the boy's naked torso. They narrowed to form an upside-down V.<br /><br />- Is it the scar tissue that narrows? Because that's how it seems.<br />- I'm no expert on anatomy, but the V thing seems odd. Wouldn't having flight muscles attached to your latissimus dorsi (I believe that's the name, but the ones that wrap from the front of your ribcage to the back) be awfully strenous? Wouldn't you build up those muscles to unrealistic and bizarre-looking proportions?<br /><br /><br />'Welcome to Human Reproduction (Sex)'<br />At my side Vee Sky said, "This is exactly why the school outlaws camera phones. Pictures of this in the e-Zine would be all the evidence I'd need to get the board of education to ax biology."<br /><br />- Is it really necessary to introduce Vee with first and last name, especially as this is written from Nora's perspective?<br />- Odds of a BoE getting rid of biology in any school curriculum are next to nil. Odds of BoE firing idiot teacher or changing the curriculum are pretty good, though.<br /><br /><br />Coach considered teaching tenth-grade biology a side assignment to his job as varsity basketball coach, and we all knew it.<br /><br />- The frick? No. Biology is an ENORMOUS subject. Anyone who teaches it and can get a job teaching it has to, by definition almost, be devoted primarily to it.<br />- For future reference, Vee and Nora are sophomores, which means they'll be between fourteen and sixteen, probably sixteen. <br /><br /><br />"Science is an investigation," Coach said, sanding his hands together. "Science requires us to transform into spies."<br /><br />- I will not digress into my own academic scientific background, but this is wrong. Science is an investigation, yes. Science requires observing things in a way which may be spy-like, yes. But it's not espionage. Deviate how you will from the scientific method, but most science is going to require experiments at one point, not just observation and certainly not just 'sleuthing'.<br /><br /><br />Vee is my un-twin. She's green-eyed, minky blond, and a few pounds over curvy. I'm a smoky-eyed brunette with volumes of curly hair that holds its own against even the best flatirn. And I'm all legs, like a bar stool.<br /><br />- Descriptioninfodump not appreciated. Bits and pieces, Ms. Fitzpatz, bits and pieces. Your readers are smart enough to 'patch' together a description from fragments scattered here and there where relevant. This spoon-feeding paragraph is distracting from the 'action' of the story and just slightly insulting to my intelligence.<br /><br /><br />My heart fumbled a beat and in that pause, a feeling of gloomy darkness seemed to slide like a shadow over me. It vanished in an instant, but I was still staring at him. His smile wasn't friendly. It was a smile that spelled trouble. With a promise.<br /><br />- Does darkness slide over something like anything but a shadow? Superflous description.<br />- If this is her first impression of Patch, it bodes ill...<br /><br /><br />Coach said, "Human reproduction can be a sticky subject."<br />"Ewww!" groaned a chorus of students.<br />"It requires mature handling. And like all science, the best approach is to learn by sleuthing. For the rest of the class, practice this technique by finding out as much as you can about your new partner."<br /><br />- Yes, it does require mature handling- which neither Fitzpatz or her character displays. Immature puns? Not amused.<br />- SLDKJFLAJ: EXPERIMENTS GODDAMMIT. Not ****ing SLEUTHING, EXPERIMENTS.<br />- 'Technique'? What technique? Word implies that he's taught them some kind of technique to use in 'sleuthing', but he clearly has not.<br />- What's with Fitzpatz's love of this word 'sleuthing' anyhow? Did she just learn what it means or something? Is she trying to show off?<br /><br /><br />I sat perfectly still. The ball was in his court- I'd smiled, and look how well that turned out.<br /><br />- We find out later that Nora wants to get into an Ivy-League school, or at least that she's capable of it. So why is someone who must have been going after her grades nigh-on aggressively her entire highschool career content to sit back passively and let someone else control the fate of an assignment? She has no drive and no persistence, obviously.<br /><br /><br />Great. At this rate I would fail.<br /> <br />- SO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT YOU TWIT.<br /><br /><br />"Call me Patch. I mean it. <i>Call me</i>."<br /><br />- Horrible pick-up line. Does Fitzpatz really think teenagers speak like this?<br />- Useless pick-up line. 'Call me' doesn't work unless you give the subject a relevant phone number.<br /><br /><br />"I wasn't finished," he said. "I've got quite a collection going of an eZine columnist who believes there's truth in eating organic, who writes poetry in secret, and who shudders at the thought of having to choose between Stanford, Yale, and... what's that big one with the H?"<br /><br />- GINORMOUS RED FLAGS. He's stalking you and taking pictures, Nora, you airhead. He's at the very least a voyeur, at the most a sexual predator. REPORT THIS SHIT. That's what the police are there for.<br />- This is Fitzpatz trying to characterize Nora through someone else's exposition- we are <b>told</b> she is all of these things, but never <b>shown</b> any of them.<br /><br /><br />The hair at the nape of my neck stood on end, and the temperature in the room seemed to chill. Ordinarily I would have gone straight to Coach's desk and requested a new seating chart.<br /><br />- I cannot believe it. She just basically ACKNOWLEDGED changing her viewpoint character's personality becausse of (what will become) TWOO WUVE FOEVAH AN EVAH. Under ordinary circumstances she would have requested a change, but because it's PATCH THE SUPER SPESHUL MAN she doesn't. Bullshit.<br /><br /><br />He was a dark-Levi's-dark-henley-dark-boots kind of guy.<br /><br />- Boots? Jeans? Henley? Agh. I pictured this and it looked horrible. Ominous maybe, fashionable definitely not.<br /><br /><br />"Go for it. I could use a hook for my next eZine article. 'Tenth Grader Fights Back.' Better yet, 'Seating Chart Takes Slap in the Face.' Mmm. I like it."<br /><br />- And from this we learn that Vee can't write for jack. Seriously lame, both of these; pompous and not in the least bit clever.<br /><br /><br />"How was school?" Dorothea asked with a slight German accent.<br /><br />- Poor description. This makes it sound like she's assuming the accent, not that it's natural.<br />- Why is the housekeeper always accented? What, people born in the USA don't need to take such jobs?<br /><br /><br />On the line beneath it I added, Smokes cigars. Will die of lung cancer. Hopefullly soon. Excellent physical shape.<br /><br />- You do realize that 'will die of lung cancer' and 'excellent physical shape' shouldn't normally go together?<br />- Why did she scribble the last comment out? He's creepy about her; she should be creepy right back. Besides, it's the most Biology-related thing she's done yet.<br /><br /><br />I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but something about Patch wasn't right. Something about him wasn't normal. Something wasn't... safe.<br /><br />- And yet you still descend into the depths of a bar that you're too young to be in to find him. Brilliant. Stanford is drooling over that.<br /><br /><br />"As it turns out, I'm in need of a healthy female sacrifice. I'd planned on luring her into trusting me first, but if you're ready now..."<br /><br />- This would make a fine joke, if it was said in a lighthearted situation, a joking tone, and to someone who wasn't already scared of Patch. As is, it just shows that he's an insensitive bastard.<br /><br /><br />Patch casually but noticeably slid his sleeve down over his wrist. "You'd prefer it someplace more private?"<br /><br />- And he officially has the Magical Ability to Turn Any Situation Into Something Perverted. Just fantastic, eh?<br /><br /><br />"Intelligent. Attractive. Vulnerable."<br /><br />- PREDATOR. Singles out those who are on the outside edges, the weakest, and then takes them down. Basic predator/prey interaction. Nora is the deer with the broken leg in this one.<br /><br /><br />"I'm starting a petition to have Coach fired," Vee said, coming to my table.<br /><br />- Why the hell is everyone referring to him as Coach? Is that his given first name? Or is he just such a whackjob that he prefers it even off the field? And besides, aren't there many coaches at this school? Vee could be referring to any of them!<br /><br /><br />"Let's give the seating chart a few more weeks. Oh, and I was serious about tutoring Patch. I'll count you in."<br /><br />- WHAT. THE. FUCK. What kind of screwed-up school did you go to, Fitzpatz, that you think teachers are like this. They're NOT. Especially not to the good students, as Nora seems to be. Teachers aren't there for the money, they're there because teaching is what they want to do. No teacher will condone, facilitate, or even allow the abuse Patch dishes out to Nora, and no teacher would not only refuse to make a simple change to ease a studen's mind but also lassoo said student into tutoring someone she is afraid of.<br /><br /><br />Vee unlocked the doors to her 1995 purple Dodge Neon.<br /><br />- What is it with Fitzpatz and the year, model, and make of these beat-up old cars? At the very least drop the year; NO ONE CARES. Hate to stereotype but your book will be read primarily by hormonal teenage girls. You don't need to appeal to the inner car mechanic in most of them, trust me.<br /><br /><br />I had never been seriously interested in anyone. How wierd was I? "It isn't about the boys, it's about... love. I haven't found it."<br /><br />- WHAT THE FUCK. AGAIN. NOT HAVING INTENSE CRUSHES DOESN'T MAKE YOU A FREAKSHOW. GOD. (and I don't use that lightly, as an atheist.) Seriously, talk to a couple of teenagers. I personally am DAMN FUCKING PROUD to have made it to sixteen years old without a first kiss. No, I'm not shitting you. Sometimes high school boys are just stupid and not worth your time; there's no shame in that. Hell, I can name someone who shares my 'romantic state' and is two years older than I am. Assuming that all teenagers are horny little idiots and that high school 'romance' is the center of their universe makes no one look worse than the IDIOT AUTHOR.<br />- Now, keeping in mind that I have little romantic experience, point two. Saving yourself for your One Twoo Wuv is all well and good in fairy tales, but in real life is impractical. Like anything you pin all your hopes on, the potential for disaster is enormous. You know the saying 'the bigger they are, the harder they fall'? Applies double to expectations. Build yourself up and it'll just be worse if/when it goes wrong. And let's face it, Nora's idiot enough that it's GONNA GO WRONG.<br /><br /><br />"Someday this is going to be us. Ravished by half-dressed cowboys. I wonder what it's like to kiss a pair of sunbaked, mud-crusted lips?"<br /><br />- MEMO TO VEE AND ALL ROMANCE WRITERS: 'Ravished' does not mean wild, passionate, consensual, kinky sex on a rug. It. MEANS. RAPE. I don't need to go on and on about how Rape Is Wrong. I think review readers understand that. I wish authors did. This word makes me so incredibly angry I can't even- I just can't.<br /><br /><br />My sixth sense graduated to high alert.<br /><br />- I swear, 'alert' should be replaced by 'school'. At least then it would be funny. As it is, SENTENCEFAIL.<br /><br /><br />At first I couldn't distinguish any facial features, and then I realized he was wearing a ski mask.<br /><br />- First off, one word: CLICHE. (This is the Review Of Much Caps.)<br />- 'At first' she couldn't distinguish facial features... and then she realized she couldn't distinguish facial features due to the ski mask. Okay, so why the 'at first'?<br /><br /><br />I watched with horror as the door began to bow. He was tearing- it- off.<br /><br />- How much will you bet me this turns out to be Patch?<br />- Dramatic- dashes- do- not- achieve- effect.<br /><br /><br />Lifting my eyes just high enough to get a look at him without appearing that I was, I took in his fine-boned, handsome face. Blond hair hung at his shoulders. Eyes the color of chrome. Unshaven. Impeccably dressed in a tailored jacket over his green sweater and dark designer jeans.<br /><br />- Tried to picture outfit; failed. Asked friend Fashion Maven to picture outfit; she rejected it. Conclude that 'Impeccably' doesn't mean what Fitzpatz thinks it means.<br />- Brought this scene up to other friend and she made good point. Why are they having breakfast at a bistro on a school morning? I could understand Vee doing this, as she doesn't give a crap for her grades, but Nora's suppsed to be Ivy-League caliber. Also, Wikipedia will tell you that bistros are defined by their food- namely things which are cooked SLOWLY. Like, say, exactly the kind of thing you really don't want to be eating when you have to be in class on time? Yeah, precisely like that.<br /><br /><br />"Mmm, check it out," said Vee. "Mr. Green Sweater is getting out of his seat. Now that's a body that hits the gym regularly. He is definitely making his way toward us, his eyes pursuing the real estate, your real estate, that is."<br /><br />- Run-on sentence; the last comma should be a period.<br />- Editorfail: Pursuing? Or did you mean 'perusing'? Though I wouldn't put it past any of these characters to get the two mixed up... if they know the word 'perusing' in the first place...<br />- I have officially joined the Veehaters.<br /><br /><br />When he didn't answer, I turned sideways. "Soap. Shampoo. Hot water."<br />"Naked. I know the drill."<br /><br />- How does this supposed supernatural creature have the exact same Awkwardness Summon abilities as a regular hormonal human teenage boy? <br />- SQUICK PATCH. SQUICK.<br /><br /><br />"Nora." The warning in Coach's voice pulled me back to my quiz, but I couldn't help speculating about what Patch's answer might have been, and it had me wanting to slide far away from him.<br /><br />- This would have been an excellent point for Fitzpatz to show us that Nora is smart and a good student, the kind of person who would have to choose between Ivies for college. Instead, she leaves us with the telling of this we got earlier and shows us Nora as a hormonal idiot who is distracted by a guy she finds creepy. Sorry if I don't believe the characterization I was <i>told</i> and instead go with what I was <i>shown</i>.<br /><br /><br />My voice caught on the word, and I wondered if after today I would ever feel like calling Vee my friend again.<br /><br />- Pity this didn't occur to Nora earlier.<br />- And yet this comment doesn't come into play later. Where's the ongoing doubt in Vee's trustworthiness or the value of her friendship? At the Delphic Amusement Park, for instance?<br /><br /><br />I was all alone, free do to as I pleased.<br />I came to a stop at the third door on the left. I sucked in a breath and knocked, but it was obvious from the darkened window that the room was empty. I pushed on the door.<br /><br />- This may seem a minor nitpick, but SENTENCE VARIATION, DAMMIT. Four sentences in a row that start with 'I (past tense verb)' are amateur. Seriously, I used to pull this formulaic shit to get out of required writing assignments when I was in elementary school. Any close-reading editor should have caught this and made Fitzpatz rewrite this little section so that it was smoother and, oh, MATURE.<br /><br /><br />He jerked his chin out the door. "I need you to exit the building immediately."<br /><br />- Mental image: chin flies out the door. Hilarious, but stupid.<br />- I dunno about Fitzpatz, but I've actually been at school during a bomb threat. And you know what they do? THEY MAKE YOU STAY PUT. You don't leave the building or even the room, especially if you're in someplace where a student shouldn't be. This reaction is ridiculous.<br /><br /><br />"All the seats here are taken," I said. When he didn't answer, I grabbed my glass back and took a sip of water, accidentally swallowing an ice cube. It burned the whole way down. "Shouldn't you be working instead of fraternizing with customers?"<br /><br />- Where's the choking 'Gaaaack, gaaack' that is normal aftermath of swallowing an ice cube? Maybe it's a nitpick, but if you're going to make your main character do something like that, use all aspects of it- wouldn't it be interesting to have her embarass herself this way in front of Patch?<br /><br /><br />Even though it would probably come back to haunt me, I was curious enough about Patch to go almost anywhere with him.<br />"I want to get you alone," Patch said.<br /><br />- Do I even have to make the comment here? Good. Because I can't compose myself enough to get past the DLSKJF; STUPID CHARACTER rant stage. So it's nice that this one speaks for itself.<br /><br /><br />He was dressed in knee-length basketball shorts and a white Nike sweatshirt.<br /><br />- What kind of imbecile wears a sweatshirt to PE, when you know you'll be sweating buckets and giving off heat like nobody's business?<br /><br /><br />"Run!" my team shouted from the dugout. "Run, Nora!"<br />I ran.<br />"Drop the bat!" they screamed.<br />I flung it aside.<br />"Stay on first base!"<br />I didn't.<br /><br />- The hell? Someone who doesn't do well in sports and doesn't like them much isn't going to go for the gusto. You take first base and you stick with it, because it's better than getting struck out. So either Nora has no strategic/logical brain at all (possible) or Patch being there completely screwed it up. (possible).<br />- Choppy writing supposed to be dramatic? Because it's not.<br /><br /><br />"Trust me, Dorth, there are no boys in my life." Okay, maybe there were two lurking on the fringe, circling from afar, but since I didn't know either very well, and one outright frightened me, it felt safer to close my eyes and pretend they weren't there.<br /><br />- Patch OUTRIGHT FRIGHTENS HER. Feh. Warning sign much, you airhead?<br />- The imagery here makes both boys sound like sharks. Eeew. Not a healthy image if you expect her to fall in love with one of them.<br /><br /><br />Dorothea had moved down the hall to the powder room.<br /><br />- No teenager in their right minds would seriously use the words 'powder room' in place of 'bathroom'. Sorry, no dice, Fitzpatz.<br /><br /><br />(To Be Continued in comments)</span>

  <span id="freeText306357759285716456" style="display:none">4.5/5 stars.<br />I read this book when I was 16.

My taste has changed over the years, and I didn't know if I would love it like I did before.<br />But here I am, after a very quick read. I started reading it on July 27, and it was only 5 days. Most of the time I wasn't even at home. I went to a concert and meetings so I didn't have time to read it, otherwise I would probably finish it on the second day lol. <br />Rare are the books I read so quickly and it says quite a bit about the book. The last time I gave it 5 stars, this time I took off half a star. don't get me wrong- it was amazing, interesting and it dragged me into the plot so I couldn't stop. But the only reason I took off a half star is probably because I grew up and teen books that tell about love when the characters see each other for the first time, bother me a little.<br />Anyway, the book was amazing and I can't wait to read the second book in the series.</span>

</blockquote> <br />It’s been about a year since I read this, so I’m not even going to <i>try</i> to give it a full review. I just really want it off of my “RTC” shelf, so I’m going to sum this up in a few points:<br /><br />1.	I hate this writing. I hate it so much. The narrative voice is everything I <b>don’t</b> miss about late 2000s YA fantasy.<br /><br />2.	Nora is a tremendously boring, unenjoyable protagonist. I remember nothing about her at all except how <i>bored</i> I was by her existence.<br /><br />3.	I promise I’m not here to judge anyone, but I heard so many people swoon over Patch that I expected… well, <i>not this.</i> He’s awful, toxic, gross, pushy, has no respect whatsoever for Nora or anything she wants, and genuinely made me want to punch myself in the face at least three times a chapter.<br /><br />That’s it. This book was awful. I had to force myself to skim the last third or so just because I wanted to see if it got any better. It didn’t. I have no desire to ever continue this series and will not recommend this book to anyone, ever. I’m so grateful that, over the last decade, YA romance has (mostly) moved away from this over-the-top toxicity in male love interests.</span>

  <span id="freeText12613507206631817732" style="display:none"><b>1 star</b><br /><br />Well .... I guess I can say I've done that now ... *tosses book in the trash*<br /><br />I was recommended this book by one of my best friends who, before now, I thought had great taste in books. I am now questioning our friendship (kidding, kidding).<br /><br />I really thought I was going to love this book. It had so many ingredients that I like. Hot boys, Dark hero, romance, danger. Turns out it also had about a bazillion of the ingredients I don't like. Predictability, instalove, abusive and controlling behavior being glorified. And to top it off, this book hit the cliché nail on the head!<br /><br />No thanks. Not for me.<br /><br /><b>The Story</b><br /><br /><i>"A SACRED OATH<br />A FALLEN ANGEL<br />A FORBIDDEN LOVE"</i><br /><br />Sounds awesome right?<br /><br />Patch is an overprotective (bordering on abusive) fallen angel. Nora is a typical high school student. Aaaaaand we all know where this is going don't we?<br /><br /><b>What I Did Not Like</b><br /><br /><br />Let's have a little talk about controlling and abusive behavior for a second. It's not cute/hot/attractive!!! Our "hero" tends to be a bit on the stalker-y/overprotective/abusive side of things and I do not feel like the issues with this behavior were ever really addressed. I just don't see a relationship starting out like this to be a lasting formula. I strongly feel like it is very dangerous for books like this to glorify and romanticize this type of behavior/situation.<br /><br />The target demographic for this book is young teenagers who are just starting to explore the idea of romantic love and sex. I really didn't have anyone to teach me what a healthy relationship was and how to spot dangerous red flags in my relationships. because of this, I ended up falling for the quintessential "bad boy" and it did not go well. Unfortunately, a lot of people in this target demographic live with similar situations. This controlling, stalker-y trope needs to be addressed. I repeat ... IT IS NOT OK! <br /><br /><b>Instalove</b> by the truckloads which is legit my second least favorite trope of all time. Insta-lust I get. It happens. But to take this <i>normal</i> human reaction and portray it as true, deep, lasting romance is absurd and I WILL NOT STAND FOR IT! *Drops mic*<br /><br />*Picks mic back up because I forgot I wasn't finished*<br /><br /><b>Predictability</b>... so much predictability. I'm sure that after my short synopsis above you could accurately guess the entire plot of this story.<br /><br />And as if that was not enough .... let's throw a good old fashion <b>love triangle</b> in there with yet more overprotective stalker-y/abusive behavior. Sounds goooooood to me... NOT!<br /><br /><b>In Conclusion</b><br /><br />I think maybe you can tell that I was not a fan? Yeah... I think that was obvious.<br /><br />There was just nothing about this story that made it special or unique to me. I think perhaps I may have enjoyed this when I was younger, but hey, I was dumb and glorifying overprotective abusive relationships of my own at the time.<br /><br />New refined me says NO to this book and I will not be continuing with this series.</span>

  <span id="freeText3546713077146712842" style="display:none">Oh My God OMG OMG OMG! Just finished Hush Hush one minute ago. I freaking LOVE this book!!!!!!! Fave book of the year!<br /><br />Edit: Here's a more err professional review.<br /><br />After reading the first two chapters on the Simon &amp; Schuster website, I knew I would love this book. And sure enough, I did. It's not like this topic hasn't been done before, forbidden romance. However Becca has written a novel with the same idea but the writing is exceptional. Reading Hush Hush was like riding a roller coaster, the story moves in a fast pace and before you know it, it's over. I long to go back into Patch's and Nora's world and experience everything again. <br /> <br />Nora is an excellent protagonist. Like Patch describes her, she's attractive, intelligent and vulnerable. Her emotions are perfectly captured and portrayed. Patch is a very intriguing guy and more so when he is reluctant to talk about his past. Though he can be provocative --and flirtatious at times, he is <em>very</em> attractive and has this 'good' side of him. Despite Nora feeling uncomfortable with Patch, she is drawn to him. Her best friend, Vee, is affable but don't insult her because she can be rather sharp-tongued! <br /><br />There is one part towards the end when everything seemed so surreal (hint: that part reminded me of Cassandra Clare's City of Bones), I wanted Nora to run and hug Patch. I wanted to cry during that part, honestly. I can feel Nora's pain and when she questions her sanity, I got quite a bit emotional at that point. <br /><br />I hereby declare Patch from Hush Hush by Becca Fitzpatrick my favourite YA guy. Trust me, by the time you are done with Hush Hush, you'll be like Edward who? <br /><br />FULL REVIEW OVER HERE: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="http://readthisbook.wordpress.com/2009/08/26/hush-hush-by-becca-fitzpatrick/">http://readthisbook.wordpress.com/200...</a></span>

  <span id="freeText10312781891638685197" style="display:none">So after reading Hush, Hush by Becca Fitzpatrick something unexpected happened. This is my story:<br />*************************<br />Leaving my house around 6:25pm, I headed out the door and I thought, just my luck on one of the most important days of my life, it’s raining cats and dogs.<br /><br />I hopped into my car and raced to my appointment in hopes of not being late. I finally arrived at the building with 3 minutes to spare. I jumped out my car without grabbing an umbrella and jogged to the entrance. As I’m walking down the hall, I see my reflection in the mirror. “God I look horrid! “ You know that look – like you’ve been dumped over the head with a bucket of water. “Oh, well there’s nothing I can do about that now.”<br /><br />Finally this is it. I’m standing at the entrance of the door that could be my possible salvation. I take a deep breath and try to control my nerves as much as possible. “Here goes nothing.” I knock on the door.<br /><br />Dr. Chen opens the door. “Hi Tina, it’s so nice to see you again. Come in, what can I do for you today?”<br /><br />I make my way over to the couch across from Dr. Chen’s desk and take a seat. At this point everything imaginable is going through my head.<br /><br />“Uh-hum” Dr. Chen clears his throat rescuing me from my jumbled thoughts.<br /><br />“I’m so sorry to disturb you at such a late hour, but I needed someone to talk to.”<br /><br />“No worries, my door is always open for you, now what seems to be the matter?”<br /><br />I shake my head “I don’t know where to start.”<br /><br />“Now, now my dear, It will be alright." He coos. "Just start from the beginning.”<br /><br />His voice is soothing. “It all started with this book I read.”<br /><br />Dr. Chen arches a brow. “A book you say?”<br /><br />“Yes, it’s called Hush, Hush by Becca Fitzpatrick.”<br /><br />Dr. Chen nods. “Ok, go on.”<br /><br />I couldn’t take this, so I blurted. “I think I’m obsessed Dr. Chen!” There. It’s out. I’ve said it.<br /><br />Dr. Chen looks confused. “What makes you think that dear?”<br /><br />“There’s this character in the book named Patch and he’s all I ever think about. I don’t know what’s wrong with me!”<br /><br />He squints and eyes me curiously. “What do you mean he’s all you think about?”<br />Oh My God. I bet he thinks I’m crazy! And as if he could read my mind, he says.<br /><br />“Tina, whatever you tell me stays between us, Patient – Doctor Confidentiality.” This is reassuring, so I go on.<br /><br />“Dr. Chen, I seem to be obsessed with a fictional character! Is that normal?”<br /><br />“Hmm.” He nods. “I see, well let me just grab my journal and see if we can put your mind at ease.”<br /><br />He walks over to his bookshelf and grabs a journal and flips to a page.<br /><br />“Yes, Yes here it is.” He slides the journal over to me and points at a photo on the page. I’m taken back by the photo staring up at me. It’s a photo of Edward Cullen, but that’s not what catches my attention, it’s the photo next to it of a dark haired, dark eyed Angel that seem to see right into your soul. Patch Cipriano.<br /><br />I look up at Dr. Chen accusingly. “What is this? Why do you have pictures of fictional characters? Is this some kind of joke?”<br /><br />He shakes his head. “I’m afraid not Tina. What you see here is a typical case of Hush, Hush fanaticism.”<br /><br />“What? What exactly does that mean?”<br /><br />“It’s rather simple really, Tina what you are experiencing is quite normal.”<br /><br />“Normal? How is this obsession normal?”<br /><br />“Let me put your mind at ease dear, you are not the only one who’s experienced this.”<br /><br />“I’m not!” I can’t believe it. I breathe a sigh of relief, then point to the picture of Patch. “How do I fix th-th-this? Whatever this is?”<br /><br />Dr. Chen smirks. “Quite easily actually, all you have to do is reread the book until he’s out of your system.”<br /><br />“Huh? Is that possible?”<br /><br />“Of Course!” He points to the photo of Patch. “Now, why don’t you tell me how you came to be obsessed with this character Patch?”<br /><br />“Do you think it will help?”<br /><br />“I most certainly do!”<br /><br />I take a deep breath and tell him my story.<br />*************************<br />If I didn’t know anything about this book, I don’t think I would ever have thought that Hush, Hush was Fitzpatrick’s debut novel. The writing is brilliant! Becca took me on a journey and I was thoroughly entertained. I was caught up in the world wind of Nora &amp; Patch at the first page, this book is addictive and I could not put it down for one minute. I broke all my review rules to read this book and that’s saying a lot!<br /><br />Fitzpatrick did a fantastic job with the characters in Hush, Hush. I laughed throughout this book at Nora and Vee’s conversations and strange dealings. These characters are so relatable paranormal aside. This is one of the reasons I love this book, these characters are downright fun and entertaining.<br /><br />What can I say about Patch? Tall, Dark &amp; Dangerously Sexy! I don’t know why he’s so alluring, maybe it’s because he’s a Bad Boy. Whatever it is, Becca did an incredible job portraying him and I can finally confess that Patch is my new fictional crush! I found myself smiling throughout this whole book.<br /><br />I love when a book can keep me guessing. This book kept me turning the pages for so many reasons. I had to know what would happen next, whether it was for sizzling scenes with Patch &amp; Nora or downright hilarious moments with Nora &amp; Vee or even the strange things happening around Nora. I absolutely, positively devoured every page! Well as you can see, I’m Hush, Hush’s #1 fan!<br /><br />I love everything about this book. I will definitely follow the doctor’s order and reread this book until I can get Patch out of my system, which may be never. So Help Me God! </span>

But sometimes you have to ignore your friends and do you.<br><br><br><br>HUSH, HUSH gets a bum rap and part of that is the fact that the hero in this book is an abusive, rapey, psychotic douchenozzle, AKA <i>my favorite kind of hero</i>. But I think part of it is also because it kinds of reads like a sexed-up version of TWILIGHT, only with angels instead of vampires, and it came out at a time when TWILIGHT and copycats were literally over-saturating the YA market and the movies were coming out and the fangirls were everywhere and there was literally no escape.<br><br><br><br>Nora Grey is an ordinary girl... until she meets Patch Cipriano, a mysterious and dangerous boy who seems interested in her, and not in a good way. After some courtship (read: stalking), Nora realizes she might be attracted to Patch (read: in mortal peril), but he might also be trying to kill her (read: it's true love). And maybe some other people might want to kill her, too. You know, for funsies.<br><br><br><br>As I said before, I like douchenozzle heroes, so I didn't have a problem with Patch. Objectively, I know he is a bad man and people like him suck IRL. But in fantasy land, as a fantasy romance hero where the reader draws the lines of consent by picking up the book and deciding when to put it down of their own volition? Yeah. This is basically the dark romance I was expecting TWILIGHT to be. It was Gothic, slow-burn action with plenty of danger and sexy parts. Nora is a better heroine than Bella; she has more of a personality and isn't afraid to talk back or defend herself.<br><br><br><br>I liked her friendship with Vee, even if it was immature and kind of silly. Vee is a curvy girl whose personality revolves around making lewd comments about boys and eating. I feel attacked. But their banter was great and you got the sense of their friendship in a way that a lot of YA books at this time failed, miserably. Just look at the friendship ex machina that was Jessica in TWILIGHT.<br><br><br><br>Honestly, I thought this was a great dark love story for teens. I read and enjoyed FALLEN, too, but this is better than FALLEN. Those angels were too broody and acted like they were using <i>Wuthering Heights </i>as their courtship bible. This was more like <i>Dogma</i>-- angels gone wild, with a dash of sass. I would definitely read the sequels if they popped up on Kindle Unlimited like this one did. I guess the moral of this review (if there is one??) is that you can't always trust your friends.<br><br><br><br>...But I knew that. ;)<br><br><br><br>JK, I love you.<br><br><br><br>4 stars</span>

(Yes, Lace, I'm talking about you!) Patch on the other hand, where do I even start. You'll either love him, hate him, or hate him so much you love him. He's the epitome of the "bad boy".... hot, dark, mysterious and cocky as hell. Characterization was awesome. I love when I have such strong emotions toward characters, it's a compliment to the authors ability to make such a three dimensional character, and Fitzpatrick is right on!<br /><br />The plot was insane, twist upon twist, up until the final pages. I could not put down. The pages inside are just as hot as the cover. Loved the history and explanation of the lore as well. The plot was just really well executed.<br /><br />The writing itself was fantastic as well. Fitzpatrick has a distinct story telling ability. It seems she's able to tell the story effortlessly and all the while keeping the readers interest profoundly intact.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the next installment in this series!</span>

<span id="freeTextContainer4503708971841767032">When I first heard about Hush, Hush by Becca Fitzpatrick, I was both intrigued and wary. The reason I was wary was because Hush, Hush is very comparable to Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight series. Now if an author can ride on Meyer’s coattails and have an original idea and really make it shine, I’m all for that.

The reason I was wary was because Hush, Hush is very comparable to Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight series. Now if an author can ride on Meyer’s coattails and have an original idea and really make it shine, I’m all for that. But in the case of Hush, Hush I’m afraid to say that Becca has not only ridden on Meyer’s coattails, but hopped on her back and took every single thing from Twilight and placed it in Hush, Hush. The comparisons between Twilight and Hush, Hush are too strong not to ignore and honestly, Hush, Hush reads like a Twilight fan fiction where Becca decided to change the characters and a bit of the plot that fails in so many ways. If you’re going to take someone else’s idea and try to build on it, at least be smart about it.<br /><br />Nora Grey and her best friend Vee Sky, who Nora calls her “un-twin” enjoy working for their school’s eZine in Coldwater, a town in Maine where the fog is very thick. Nora lives on the outskirts of town in an eighteenth century farmhouse with her mother who works for an auction company that requires a great deal of traveling. Nora’s father is no longer around because he was shot to death. But Nora is seeing a therapist to come to terms about her father’s death. She feels as if her father is watching her from above because she has always felt a presence watching over her from a distance.<br /><br />Nora is in for a surprise when she goes to her Biology class and her teacher decides to change the seating chart. Nora’s new Bio partner is the new transfer who goes by the name of Patch. The new guy is dark very much in the literal sense from the top of his head to the tips of his toes. He has “cool black eyes” and when his eyes slice into Nora, she feels a “gloomy darkness like a shadow” over her. Patch also has an interesting scent to him, of “something richer, fouler”, much like cigars. Nora and Patch’s introduction doesn’t go that well because he is very rude, crude and speaks in sexual innuendos. His disrespect towards Nora makes her very uncomfortable.<br /><br />You would think a guy like Patch, who is very much a verbal bully would make Nora offended. But there is something about Patch that speaks to her as in, this guy is a jerk and seems dangerous, but he looks good in black, so I’m going to find out whatever I can about him. Because Vee is also very noisy, she and Nora team up to find about Patch’s deep dark secrets.<br /><br />Around the same time Nora begins her investigation; strange things start to happen. She runs over a guy in a ski mask with her car who then attacks her by bashing in her window. She begins seeing this phantom ski mask person everywhere after. Also, two new boys have entered on the scene. Jules and Elliott meet Nora and Vee at a bistro. Elliott has transferred from Kinghorn Prep to Coldwater High. Vee is over the moon at having fresh blood… two new cute boys to hang out with. Jules, who still attends Kinghorn, is moody and rude while Elliott, who at first seems pretty nice, becomes very aggressive and mean for no reason. Nora realizes something is up with Elliott and Jules, just because they are so moody and mean! And because Nora is such a great sleuth, she goes to the library and Google’s Elliott’s name where she finds out he may or may have not murdered a girl at Kinghorn.<br /><br />As all this is going on, Patch seems to pop up wherever Nora is. He taunts her, much like a rebel on his motorcycle (which he has) and dares her to come walk on the wild side with him. They go on a scary ride at the boardwalk, he comes to her house and makes her dinner but holds a knife in such a way that Nora thinks he may stab her at one point with it. Whenever she is in dark scary places, Patch is there with his cold black eyes. And Nora thinks she is going crazy because she swears she can hear Patch talking in her head.<br /><br />And again the sleuth that Nora is, where she has channeled Nancy Drew, goes to the library and begins to research fallen angels because of some strange V like scars on Patch’s back that are “angel wing scars”. Nora now knows that Patch is not human. And things become worse because someone is out to hurt Nora. Vee is caught in the middle, and Jules and Elliott are also be involved. Nora has no choice but to turn to Patch. And what she sees through his eyes, by touching his no touch zone on his back, will shock her to the very core!<br /><br />Hush, Hush should have a lot to recommend about it. I will begin to say that Becca’s writing is commendable, but the way she has set things are so disjointed and stilted. I did like Nora in the beginning but then she ventured into the too stupid to live zone. The way she and Vee acted in regards to Patch was too immature and eye rolling. Why would you be so interested in Patch who comes across as a verbally abusive individual who makes you frightened for your life? Nora is never really attracted to Patch because the majority of the time she lives in fear of him. At one point she is in the library underground parking garage and plays catch me if you can around a car with Patch because she doesn’t want him to come near her. She thinks he is possibly the crazy ski mask man, the one who beat up a girl who was mean to her and every time she is with him, she has a sense of impending doom. At no point do we see Nora giving any real reason why she would be so interested in Patch. There is nothing redeemable about him in the least. Want to hear a big cliché? Nora is on a bus and gets off a stop where the bus driver says it’s not safe. Nora shrugs it off and actually walks down a dark, dank alley! Good grief.<br /><br />As for Patch he is a manipulative jerk. I can’t help but bring up the comparison with him and Edward.<br /><br />***This is a spoiler, so beware!**<br /><br />I’ve read the countless discussions in regards to Meyer’s Edward, where he is a stalker and a murderer. The thing with Edward and his desire with Bella is that his need to kill her is more instinct and a deep hunger because Bella is his food, if you think about it. Edward grapples with this nature and overcomes his need. With Patch, his need to kill Nora is not because of an elemental need or hunger, but simply a means to an end, a reward he will receive. Patch has a way to reach his ultimate goal if he gets rid of Nora. There is no reason for him to hold back and not kill her that I can think of because there is nothing wonderful to recommend about Nora.<br /><br />Hush, Hush is a rehash of Twilight plain and simple. Examples such as:<br /><br />- Nora and Patch being partners in Bio class.<br />- Patch being dark, mysterious and dangerous, yet Nora can’t stay way.<br />- Nora lists attributes in regards to Patch much like Bella did with Edward, where she comes to these conclusions what Patch is.<br />- Nora is placed time and again in danger because of her own stupidity and her interactions and constant obsessing over Patch.<br /><br />Need I go on?<br /><br />Becca Fitzpatrick has written the complete opposite of what a healthy teenage romance should be. Patch is the perfect example of what an abusive near psycho boyfriend would be and Nora the weak, lost girl who thinks she is strong but isn’t. If I had to recommend a book to a young girl looking for a bad boy who is redeemed by love, Hush, Hush would never be mentioned.<br /><br />I wish there was one positive thing I could say about Hush, Hush. I simply can’t. From the unbelievable actions of Nora and Vee to the near villain like tendencies of Patch, to the too many comparisons to count to Meyer’s Twilight, Hush, Hush belongs more as the musing of a fan fiction writer than a published novel that has no place in being read by impressionable young teens or the older audience who should know better to enjoy something like this.</span>

  <span id="freeText8366983288454901356" style="display:none">*<b>Important update, 8/13/2011</b>: I read this book a year and a half ago and gave it five stars. Like <i>Evermore</i>, I don't feel like rereading the book to assign it a rating more akin to my current tastes. If I did I would probably give it three or four stars. You can read my review from a long time ago below, though I would recommend reading other more cultivated reviews...<br /><br />Nora Gray is the typical over-achieving high school girl in the sense that she aims to go Yale, has a best friend, and has a somewhat dysfunctional family. Even her name seems synonymous with plain and simple. However, the reasons that Nora isn't the typical high school girl are many: she is independent, even at her age, because her mom travels a lot after her dad passed away. Her best friend Vee is obsessed with all the things Nora chooses to ignore - boys, shopping, and drama. And Nora is about to experience her first taste of real danger in the delectable Patch Cipriano, the sexy, mysterious boy she finds herself sitting next to in biology class one morning. Patch radiates tall, dark, and handsome, and the following day Nora realizes that she seems to be seeing him... everywhere.<br /><br /><i>Hush, Hush</i> deserved a much better synopsis than that. However, it's difficult to entail all the things in the plot that make the book magnificent without spoilers appearing. So that will have to do. Even though the multiple summaries of the book and maybe even the book jacket allude to this book being the typical "girl meets dangerous boy" type or ordeal, it isn't. It really isn't.<br /><br />I have to gush about Patch. Once again I don't want to give anything a way so my description might be vague but he's the type that would make any teenage girl or maybe even questioning boy swoon and blush along with Nora. He was the epitome of sexy and mysterious without overdoing it, he never became too much like other guys in other YA fiction, he was always dark and throughout the book questionable in a mysteriously appealing way. Patch Cipriano is just... wow. Definitely in my top 10 male characters of all time.<br /><br />Also, I really enjoyed Nora and Vee's friendship. Everything they did together, whether is was arguing about boys or skipping out on their diets together was just so real, and never forced. As a teenager I could easily distinguish between an author trying to hard to create a friendship, and an author who really hits the nail on the head. Fitzpatrick did just that - I always looked forward to and enjoyed their shared dialogue. Actually, all the characters in this book were great and more than just one-dimensional archetypes. Even the antagonist, who is sure to surprise readers by the end of the novel.<br /><br />The plot... wow, it was amazing. The story hooked me in and never let me go. I've said this about other novels but <i>Hush, Hush</i> was absolutely terrific. Even the most simple scenes were described with an underlying sense of terror and intrigue, the whole book flowed together smoothly and there were never dull moments or overstated moments.<br /><br />So taking all things into consideration I would recommend this book to... everyone. I think it's important to get the point across that this book isn't a typical girl meets boy love story with a dark edge, it's much more than that. It has all the elements that make reading a book worthwhile - fascinating descriptions of scenery, terrific writing, intriguing characters, and an addicting plot that includes a modern civilization intertwined with a supernatural world. </span>

</a><br><br>one of them is a fallen angel, another is a death angel, a third is a descendant of angels, and the fourth is having what's known as "trouble with angels". you figure out who is who, no spoilers allowed!<br><br>NEXT WILL BE SPOILERS<br><i>but honestly who cares - if this is your kind of book, you should have read it already. and if you haven't by now, that doesn't matter either because the book is 10 years old and Young Adult years are like dog years so it has basically been around for what feels like 70 years and so you know all about it anyway.</i><br><br>I have so many parts of this book lodged up in my mind that I'm still dumbfounded by, I just don't know if I can list them all. I could go on and on about the worst best friend ever - I mean this girl doesn't just continually humiliate our heroine in public, she calls in a bomb threat to the high school to enable her buddy's stalking, and later tries to force her to go camping with some dude that just physically assaulted her (not the hero this time, and not even a stalker, just the third point on the love triangle) by excusing it as "he was just drunk" because LOL isn't that a great excuse! but I not only can't stand that character, she's not even a stalker either, so I'm not going to waste more time on Worst Best Friend. although I think I just wasted a lot of time on her.<br><br>instead I will just treasure the memory of that one stalking scene (so many to choose from) where the heroine goes from a booth in a restaurant to the bathroom to change into what appears to be a hooker outfit so that she can question a bartender at the same restaurant. that was definitely some creative <s>stalking</s> investigating and the hooker outfit was um completely necessary.<br><br>the hero has - in addition to chiseled abs, dangerous eyes that you can get lost in, and apparently a body that smells like a combination of mint and cigars (not joking) - quite a lot of mysterious powers. these powers include telepathy, which allows him to cheekily and sometimes sexily enter her mind to read her thoughts and sexually harass her and of course eventually save her life and - in another moment I will always treasure - help her do better at baseball.<br><br>I know that the other big controversy about this book besides the stalking is the hero's tendency to invade the heroine's personal space and get super handsy and say dirty things to her, often in the middle of class with the teacher egging him on, but I'm not going to critique that, because even though the heroine says she doesn't want him to do that she often realizes she loves it and then she often realizes she hates it because he's scary except that she actually loves it, he's so hot, except no she actually hates it, he's a predator, no he's her protector, except that he literally said he planned on killing her, except she thinks he can't possibly mean it, so she loves it, except she actually feels she hates it, except she actually loves it, no she hates how he chases her around the parking garage, well she may as well get a ride home from him after that, go ahead and invite yourself in and there are some knives you can wave around at me that's not threatening at all because he's just making tacos, no she hates it no she loves it no she actually doesn't appreciate being locked in a motel room with him, no she loves it, oops all of her clothes are soaked and there's only a towel to wear, oops his t-shirt is soaked better take it off, no she hates it, no, really, she loves it, so I guess it's all okay and consensual, and after all, he does love her! love wins!<br><br><u>fun fact</u>: did you know there is a whole subgenre of erotic fiction devoted to "mind control"? <br><br>well everyone has their kinks, so I'm not judging. oh yes I am. Becca Fitzgerald clearly loves this subgenre. poor weak-minded Stalker #2 (our heroine) gets mind-controlled so hard and so long by Stalker #1 (hero) &amp; Stalker #4 (final boss) that it goes from weird to confusing to uh oh am I reading about a fetish that the author accidentally decided to tell the world about? at first, it's relatively harmless mind control, like making you think your seat belt flew off and causing you to almost fall out of a roller coaster but you don't, LOL he's just messing with you, he doesn't really want to kill you, except he does. but at the *cough* climax, it's no longer just illusions anymore, boyfriend psychically enters girlfriend's body to literally control how her body moves, and it's just so literal I was like Author! c'mon! and of course it's to save her life so no harm no foul, that's kind of an assumed consent, right? make that body move bro, she loves it. oops, now she's dead. but don't worry - he also has the power to raise that hot teen body from the dead!<br><br><u>a happy ending</u>: of course all's well that ends well because our hero levels up into a "guardian angel" (for real) and so now he gets to literally stalk her forever. and maybe a little mind control too, to keep things fresh?<br><br><a href="https://app.photobucket.com/u/markmonday/p/6e1b8f79-84f4-4e6a-bb52-bdeff843dbc9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">

  <i>Postscript</i>

Although that love eventually turned into more of an earnest and realistic friendship, I am still very fond of YA.<br> <br>Anyway, here's what I've read and what I still need to read:<br><br><s>

    <blockquote>“If you’re an angel, where are your wings?”</blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br /><br />When you start the book, you will realize that it quite similar to Lux Series by Jennifer L. Armentrout and Twilight Series by Stephenie Meyer. Only this time there are no vampires or aliens. This time the girl deals with angels.<br /><br />The premises and the characters are similar in these three series (Lux, Twilight and Hush Hush). A small town where everyone knows everyone. The local school. A girl with no many friends and with a single parent who is almost no existent in her everyday life.<br /><br />Nora will be interested in the weird, extremely good looking boy in her class who (for some strange reasons) will become her class partner and they need to do projects together.<br /><br />Patch is a boy who is interested in Nora and not interested in Nora at the same time, who helps Nora and then intimidates her and who talks with riddles (ring any bells?).<br />There are hot situations between them and cold situations between them. <br />And they both bump at each other all the time.<br /><br /><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“You look tired. Rough night?” he whispered.<br />“I saw you at the library.” I was careful to keep my pencil gliding over my quiz, seemingly hard at work.<br />“The highlight of my night.”<br />“Were you following me?”<br />He tipped his head back and laughed softly.<br />I tried a new angle. “What were you doing there?”<br />“Getting a book.”</blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br /><br />There is no doubt and this is not a spoiler (just look at the book cover) that Patch is an Angel. But what kind of angel?<br />A warrior angel?<br />A fallen anger?<br />A guardian angel?<br />A good angel?<br />A bad angel?<br />A misunderstood angel?<br />A nephilim?<br />Or maybe a demon that pretends to be an angel?<br /><br /><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“Ride the Archangel with me.”<br />I craned my neck, staring up at it. High-pitched screams echoed down as the cars thundered over the tracks.<br />“Two people to a seat.” His smile changed to a slow, daring grin.<br />“No.” No way.<br />“If you keep running from me, you’re never going to figure out what’s really going on.”</blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br /><br />And moreover<br />Does Patch want to help Nora?<br />Does he want to kill her because he is bad?<br />Does he want to kill her because she is bad?<br />Does he want to kiss her?<br />Does he want to stab her?<br />Does he want to be her lover?<br />Does he want to be her friend?<br /><br /><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“Scared?” he murmured.<br />“No.”<br />“Liar.”<br />My pulse edged up a degree. “I’m not scared of you.”<br />“No?”<br />I spoke without thinking. “Maybe it’s just that I’m scared of—” I cursed myself for even beginning the sentence. What was I supposed to say now? I was not about to admit to Patch that everything about him frightened me. It would be giving him permission to provoke me further. “Maybe it’s just that I’m scared of … of—”<br />“Liking me?”</blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br /><br />And lastly, who is Nora really?<br />Is she a special snowflake?<br />Is she a collateral damage?<br />Is she important only for Patch or also for several other people?<br /><br /><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“It’s very helpful to know your viewpoint, Nora. Which is what I was trying to understand all along. I’ll make a note of your feelings in your file. Anything else you want to talk about?”<br />“Nope.”</blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br /><br />You will get most of the answers towards the end, while the secondary characters complicate the mystery (Nora’s best friend aka Vee, the new boy in school that wants to become Nora’s friend aka Elliot, his scary bulky buddy, the strange attacker with the ski mask, the new psychologist in school).<br /><br />There is a resolution in the end, but there are still unanswered questions (at least for me):<br />Why does Nora need to take iron pills regularly (a few times per day)?<br />How Nora’s father died and maybe why did he die?<br />Are Nora and Patch now in the friend zone or will they become something more (ok the last one is not really a question. It’s a wistful thinking that their relationship will finally develop)<br /><br />So, I have read a few negative reviews and I do not really understand what people expect. This is a young adult series and the main characters are 16 years old. <br />I am really happy with what I have read. It is an engaging book with a touch of mystery and a lot of paranormal elements. <br /><br />4 stars for the story and<br />1 extra star for the amazing book cover<br /><br /></span>

  <span id="freeText12027311323176070584" style="display:none"><b>1.5 Stars</b><br><br>The half is there for the sole reason that <i>Hush, Hush</i> did not irk me as much as <i>Halo</i> did. I’m a little confused by that but whatevs.<br><br><b>Wow.</b><br>Just wow. <br>No, this is not a good wow.<br>This is a “Holy shit, you really did that didn’t you? I can’t fucking believe that” kind of wow.<br>A wow that just destroys my very soul and forces me to wonder WHY someone could possibly like a book such as this. But don’t worry, I have an explanation as to why someone could enjoy these honey bunches of pages because I too was feeling the tug that Fitzpatrick was trying to put on me. More on that later in the review.<br><br>But let’s get started with my first statement on this subject matter. This is my first taste into the world of YA’s terrifying epidemic. The tragic disease known as “rape culture”, the new culture of Young Adult books focusing on physical abuse and awkward closeness and “No means Yes” as A-okay for a healthy, sparkly, loving relationship! <b>Because it’s so real and relatable or something.</b><br><br>Honestly, is anyone that much of a masochist, to allow themselves to get beat up and say, “Ohh yeah baby you got it”? What deranged demon possessed these authors to create such beastly, horrid books that encourage this utter nonsense? I’ll tell you what demon: Raphy the Rape Devil (the “h” is silent). Raphy goes and poisons the mind of these PNR authors that were apparently all there when they wrote these damn books. I call shenanigans on that, by the by.<br><br>Oh right, I have to talk about the book.<br><br><i>Hush, Hush</i> is a book with a title that sounds interesting but has no meaning to whatever story was in this book. Actually, if I think of it by Raphy and the Rape Culture View, <i>Hush, Hush</i> is what Patch always to shut up Nora so he could abuse her. That’s my thought anyway. Normally I’d feel bad for someone in Nora’s position, but 10 times out of 9, she just takes it and gets turned on and shit. It’s disgusting.<br><br><b>But let’s get to the breakdown we’re all waiting for, yes?</b><br><br>There were too many times that the style Fitzpatrick used bothered me. The upside was that we were definitely in Nora’s head, but it was SO MUCH SO that I wanted out of Nora’s head. I must also say that even though the characters themselves were horrible stupid people, I could still tell who said what in quotes. The characters had voices of their own, as similar as they were.<br><br>But lemme get to what I mentioned earlier about how people could enjoy this. I’m a fan of shoujo manga, like the stupid nonsensical, “the hell is even happening?” shoujo manga. It’s this kind of nonsense that <i>Hush, Hush</i> must have based itself off of. If I had first seen this is a manga format, and I kid you not, I might have enjoyed it. Because it’s dumb and isn’t supposed to make sense, and pictures!<br><br>Instead, Becca Fitzpatrick was honestly trying for a serious story with serious bad boy tones and stalkers! Patch is supposed to be our bad boy love interest. A tortured soul or whatever. And she pulls it off with phrases like:<br><br>"<i>Call me Patch. I mean it.</i> Call me."<br><br>"<i>Soap. Shampoo. Hot water.”<br>“Naked. I know the drill.</i>”<br><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380361424ra/712404.gif" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br><br>This isn’t remotely cute or endearing!! Becca, do you hear me? <b>WHAT IS CUTE AND ENTICING ABOUT THIS DUMB KID?</b> Even if he’s a bad boy, we should find something that draws us to him. But no, we just watch Nora draw him in like, “Ohmigawd he so bad and yet so good! ME WANT, ME WANT.” And yet we don’t even know why the fuck she wants him and his ass.<br><br>But yes, this is why I was feeling Fitzpatz’s tug on getting me to like this book. I saw it as a stupid shoujo and I was actually enjoying myself for a time. As fucked up and strange as that is...it’s how I saw it. Also the wonderful advice from Karen (I think? I’m sure it was Karen), to treat Hush, Hush as a big fat joke really helped me out through this. I’m not as enraged as I was when I finished <i>Halo</i>.<br><br>She also said fairly stupid things like:<br><br>“<i>I affected a yawn.</i>”--How does one affect a yawn?<br><br>“<i>Because other angels were good. Patch was not.</i>”-- YOU FIGURED IT OUT!! <br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380361424ra/712405.gif" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br><br>It was so STUPID for a girl who was supposedly Harvard-smart to think like this. Lololol this was such a dumb book.<br><br>Oh right there were characters in here, weren’t there?<br>Let’s tear them up.<br><br><b>Nora “I’M DRAWN TO UNREAL ATTRIBUTES OF THE OPPOSITE SEX” Grey</b><br><br>This girl is dumb. Really dumb. HOWEVER, she is smarter than Bethany Church. She is smarter than a rock (even if it’s just a little bit). She does take initiative when she’s trying to keep from Patch. But of course, that has to be short lived because c’mon, when is a book about something other than romance interesting? Nora has to fall in lust with Patch and hunt down his past! That is the <b>only way Young Adult works derrr</b>.<br>Oh what’s that? You want to know how Nora tries to figure out Patch’s past before molesting his scar?<br><br>WELL, instead of the rational thing and just sitting him down and chatting, Nora makes this big deal about going to his private file (you know, private records that are private for a REASON?), and digging more about him.<br><br>Actual quote on the matter: “<i>So what if there was private information inside? As Patch's biology partner, I had a right to know these things.</i>”<br><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380361424ra/712406.gif" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br><br>No one has a right to anyone’s files but their own. It’s common sense, common courtesy, and Im sure she’d get kicked out of school or suspended or something if caught. So to avoid getting caught, Tweedle Nora and Tweedle Vee CALL IN A BOMB THREAT. Because that’ll get everyone out of the school and get the whole police force IN the school and completely defeat the purpose.<br><br>Also, I want to elaborate on a particular point in this book where Nora gets his record and finds nothing on immunization and finds it wrong. I am not immunized. I had to sign legal papers to be accepted into a New York college, etc etc, it’s a difficult process.<br><br>Moving on to why this moment really pissed me off. Nora thought it “wasn’t right” for Patch to have no immunization record. This is as if Fitzpatrick is relaying her beliefs on me that “anyone is weird and not right if they’ve never been immunized”. Doing that on top of rape culture? Fuck you to hell. I don’t have an immunization record, but you don’t see me losing it, or being ‘not quite there’. I get legitimately sick a total of 2-3 days a year. I’m a healthy kid.<br><br>Nora really isn’t a person, or a cutout of an archetype. She’s a puppy to Patch’s will, and that in itself simply infuriated me. But like this immunization biz, Nora just can’t wrap her head around simple concepts. Like there are indeed people in this world without a Facebook, blog, or Myspace, and they still exist. You don’t need access to a social site to exist, just a beating heart.<br><br>She also finds it A-okay to talk about her dead father. Now that’s one thing. I’m more than glad that Nora is not trying to hide him like Vanessa Sands did with her sister in goddamn <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6970490.Siren__Siren___1_" title="Siren (Siren, #1) by Tricia Rayburn" rel="nofollow noopener">Siren</a>. But when she does talk about him, she talks about how he was murdered like it’s casual conversation. She isn’t even FAZED by it. What? I still choke up when I talk about my dead dog! I’m so confused.<br><br>Enough about that Nora chick. I don’t like her.<br><br><b>PATCH “IMMA BAD BOY” CIPRIANO OR WHATEVER</b><br><br>This is a boy that makes girls squeal apparently by saying things such as:<br><br>“<i>I wanna do a lot of things to your body.</i>”<br>“<i>Well I’m in need of a healthy female sacrifice. I’d planned on luring her into trusting me first...</i>”<br>“<i>I like vulnerable woman.</i>”<br>“<i>I did plan on killing you.</i>”<br><br><b>EVERYONE’S NORMAL REACTIONS WOULD BE THIS</b><br><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380361424ra/712407.gif" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380361424ra/712408.gif" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380361424ra/712409.gif" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380361424ra/712410.gif" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br><br>But Patch will always be there to getcha. Alllllllwaaaaayssssssss....<br><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380361424ra/712411.gif" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br><i>*shudder*</i><br><br>Patch is a rapist. He is abusive, strange, and an asshole. A HUGE asshole, even more asshole than the lovable assholes of every shoujo manga I ever read. He wears a baseball cap and tends to get shirtless and has an awkward lambda-like scar on his back. Patch is a bad dude. Not the lovable bad boy, but the “YOU SHOULD BE RUNNING” bad boy.<br><br>Not once did I find Patch reassuring, kind, helpful, respectful, funny, or interesting. It was a steaming pile of shit and rape. All he wants is Nora’s legs, preferably open me thinks. God I just can’t express my hatred for Patch. I’m too tired to think about it.<br><br>Vee was a dumb friend, somehow feeling happy and go-lucky while on PAINKILLERS (they don’t work that way). She was helpless and stupid. I’m surprised that even Nora had a brain cell or two more than her.<br><br>Why was Elliot so evil? Why was he just killed and what not? Are we ever diving into Papa Grey’s murder orrr...?<br><br>I’m sick of these characters, let’s move on.<br><br><b>DAT STRUCTURE</b><br><br>What structure? Oh the usually Twilight structure of LOVE LOVE LOVE then last 15% of book can be plot I guess. Nora was Bella, Patch was a worse version of Eddiekins, and the whole clusterfuck called <i>Hush, Hush</i> was just an introduction into the world of rape culture.<br><br>The littler tykes gotta know this: ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS ARE BAD. There is nothing healthy or life-changing about an abusive boyfriend and “He hurts me cuz he loves me”. It’s sick, degrading, and horrifying. There is NOTHING RIGHT ABOUT IT SO STOP PRAISING IT AS RIGHT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME, FITZPATZ AND SMALLER TEENAGE GIRLS OF THE WORLD.<br><br>This is glorifying abuse. This is <i>glorifying terrible things that are frowned upon in today’s society</i>. What is this book.<br><br>Moving on, there was no structure in this book, but I didn’t need to tell you all that since I’m a little late to the Snark Party. Nothing was happening in a decent order. Jules/Chauncey was a stupid villain because he wasn’t even around enough to be considered as such in my eyes. Fitzpatz cleverly avoided characterization.<br><br>Overall, why are you picking this up and trying to enjoy it? If you MUST enjoy it, enjoy it as a stupid shoujo manga. You might get some entertainment out of it. Other than that, this book is just fucking horrible. TERRIBLE. You don’t care about anyone in here. Nothing life-changing happens, and nothing is even remotely exciting.<br><br>Too many times did I sit and go, “Nora’s gone get raped isn’t she? WHY ISN’T SHE RUNNING. WHY IS SHE SO DEAD PAN I DON’T GET IT.” I was utterly appalled.<br><br>This is a really really dumb book. So dumb that I had a hard time getting my snark out. You can tell by all the gifs I used herpderp. Whatever. <br><br>Never pick up this book.<br>Hide it if you can.<br><br></span>

She doesn’t drink or swear, and she has the appropriate number of cardigans in her wardrobe. Abby believes she has enough distance from the darkness of her past, but when she arrives at college with her best friend, her path to a new beginning is quickly challenged by Eastern University\'s Walking One-Night Stand. \n\nTravis Maddox, lean, cut, and covered in tattoos, is exactly what Abby needs—and wants—to avoid. He spends his nights winning money in a floating fight ring, and his days as the ultimate college campus charmer. Intrigued by Abby’s resistance to his appeal, Travis tricks her into his daily life with a simple bet. If he loses, he must remain abstinent for a month. If Abby loses, she must live in Travis’s apartment for the same amount of time. Either way, Travis has no idea that he has met his match.<\/span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"15030808654828735804\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent(\$(this));; return false;\">...more<\/a>\n\n    <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\' id=\'9_book_11505797\'>\n<div class=\'wtrUp wtrLeft\'>\n<form action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" method=\"post\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"IpoMSrbw2F20Dpu+se2NVfXimrTUjguDyRSKE+vedf3+mV4V1qinSa3z5HRexygeaqjyBM5aoDGSAkIQraCpKg==\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_id\" id=\"book_id\" value=\"11505797\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\" value=\"to-read\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"unique_id\" id=\"unique_id\" value=\"9_book_11505797\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"wtr_new\" id=\"wtr_new\" value=\"true\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_choice\" id=\"from_choice\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_home_module\" id=\"from_home_module\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"ref\" id=\"ref\" value=\"\" class=\"wtrLeftUpRef\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"existing_review\" id=\"existing_review\" value=\"false\" class=\"wtrExisting\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_origin\" id=\"book_origin\" value=\"related_works\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_referrer\" id=\"page_referrer\" value=\"https://www.google.com/\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_url\" id=\"page_url\" value=\"/book/show/6339664-hush-hush\" />\n<button class=\'wtrToRead\' type=\'submit\'>\n<span class=\'progressTrigger\'>Want to Read<\/span>\n<span class=\'progressIndicator\'>saving…<\/span>\n<\/button>\n<\/form>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'wtrRight wtrUp\'>\n<form class=\"hiddenShelfForm\" action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" method=\"post\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"lAFarqlBhrRp4c8iSIsBw4/xGbcoVR/7RruCW+gnC4FIAgjxyRn5oHAcsOinoaSIELtxBzKBtEkdrUpYrlnXVg==\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"unique_id\" id=\"unique_id\" value=\"9_book_11505797\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_id\" id=\"book_id\" value=\"11505797\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"a\" id=\"a\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_choice\" id=\"from_choice\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_home_module\" id=\"from_home_module\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_origin\" id=\"book_origin\" value=\"related_works\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_referrer\" id=\"page_referrer\" value=\"https://www.google.com/\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_url\" id=\"page_url\" value=\"/book/show/6339664-hush-hush\" />\n<\/form>\n\n<button class=\'wtrShelfButton\'><\/button>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'ratingStars wtrRating\'>\n<div class=\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\'>\nError rating book.

Then the body disappears into thin air. It\'s hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing―not even a smear of blood―to show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy?\n\nThis is Clary\'s first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It\'s also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace\'s world with a vengeance when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight?

The opportunity to escape the life laid out for them since birth. To be swept up in a world of glittering gowns and priceless jewels. To live in a palace and compete for the heart of gorgeous Prince Maxon.\n\nBut for America Singer, being Selected is a nightmare. It means turning her back on her secret love with Aspen, who is a caste below her. Leaving her home to enter a fierce competition for a crown she doesn\'t want. Living in a palace that is constantly threatened by violent rebel attacks.\n\nThen America meets Prince Maxon. Gradually, she starts to question all the plans she\'s made for herself—and realizes that the life she\'s always dreamed of may not compare to a future she never imagined.<\/span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"13193180631685327008\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent(\$(this));; return false;\">...more<\/a>\n\n    <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\' id=\'11_book_10507293\'>\n<div class=\'wtrUp wtrLeft\'>\n<form action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" method=\"post\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"Q3ykD6O1tYFTkBWh8ZskD6GBtFwX6pd20dbe6IOB0QGff/ZQw+3KlUptamsesYFEPsvc7A0+PMSKwBbrxf8N1g==\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_id\" id=\"book_id\" value=\"10507293\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\" value=\"to-read\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"unique_id\" id=\"unique_id\" value=\"11_book_10507293\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"wtr_new\" id=\"wtr_new\" value=\"true\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_choice\" id=\"from_choice\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_home_module\" id=\"from_home_module\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"ref\" id=\"ref\" value=\"\" class=\"wtrLeftUpRef\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"existing_review\" id=\"existing_review\" value=\"false\" class=\"wtrExisting\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_origin\" id=\"book_origin\" value=\"related_works\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_referrer\" id=\"page_referrer\" value=\"https://www.google.com/\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_url\" id=\"page_url\" value=\"/book/show/6339664-hush-hush\" />\n<button class=\'wtrToRead\' type=\'submit\'>\n<span class=\'progressTrigger\'>Want to Read<\/span>\n<span class=\'progressIndicator\'>saving…<\/span>\n<\/button>\n<\/form>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'wtrRight wtrUp\'>\n<form class=\"hiddenShelfForm\" action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" method=\"post\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"MZz7OoTnsF8s1PLPke6mBP1BofpL2Wny8MqlLdyvgGbtn6ll5L/PSzUpjQV+xANPYgvJSlENwkCr3G0umtFcsQ==\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"unique_id\" id=\"unique_id\" value=\"11_book_10507293\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_id\" id=\"book_id\" value=\"10507293\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"a\" id=\"a\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_choice\" id=\"from_choice\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_home_module\" id=\"from_home_module\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_origin\" id=\"book_origin\" value=\"related_works\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_referrer\" id=\"page_referrer\" value=\"https://www.google.com/\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_url\" id=\"page_url\" value=\"/book/show/6339664-hush-hush\" />\n<\/form>\n\n<button class=\'wtrShelfButton\'><\/button>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'ratingStars wtrRating\'>\n<div class=\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\'>\nError rating book.

Welcome to the Infernal Devices trilogy, a stunning and dangerous prequel to the New York Times bestselling Mortal Instruments series.The year is 1878.

Enter an enchanting new world, where true love never dies...After a horrible accident claims the lives of her family, sixteen-year-old Ever Bloom can see people\'s auras, hear their thoughts, and know someone\'s entire life story by touching them. Going out of her way to avoid human contact to suppress her abilities, she has been branded a freak at her new high school—but everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste.Damen is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy. He\'s the only one who can silence the noise and random energy in her head—wielding a magic so intense, it\'s as though he can peer straight into her soul. As Ever is drawn deeper into his enticing world of secrets and mystery, she\'s left with more questions than answers. And she has no idea just who he really is—or what he is. The only thing she knows to be true is that she\'s falling deeply and helplessly in love with him.<\/span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"16432576515697448363\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent(\$(this));; return false;\">...more<\/a>\n\n    <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\' id=\'21_book_3975774\'>\n<div class=\'wtrUp wtrLeft\'>\n<form action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" method=\"post\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"g+y5w1rBEx/2ulCMqWjz2NXFKaUwDWcZbRJo1gxinutf7+ucOplsC+9HL0ZGQlaTSo9BFSrZzKs2BKDVShxCPA==\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_id\" id=\"book_id\" value=\"3975774\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\" value=\"to-read\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"unique_id\" id=\"unique_id\" value=\"21_book_3975774\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"wtr_new\" id=\"wtr_new\" value=\"true\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_choice\" id=\"from_choice\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_home_module\" id=\"from_home_module\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"ref\" id=\"ref\" value=\"\" class=\"wtrLeftUpRef\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"existing_review\" id=\"existing_review\" value=\"false\" class=\"wtrExisting\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_origin\" id=\"book_origin\" value=\"related_works\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_referrer\" id=\"page_referrer\" value=\"https://www.google.com/\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_url\" id=\"page_url\" value=\"/book/show/6339664-hush-hush\" />\n<button class=\'wtrToRead\' type=\'submit\'>\n<span class=\'progressTrigger\'>Want to Read<\/span>\n<span class=\'progressIndicator\'>saving…<\/span>\n<\/button>\n<\/form>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'wtrRight wtrUp\'>\n<form class=\"hiddenShelfForm\" action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" method=\"post\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"YAnRTKLkcxp8f8psog3w2k2I+plCZLPwbjyyTUyLbuu8CoMTwrwMDmWCtaZNJ1WR0sKSKViwGEI1KnpOCvWyPA==\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"unique_id\" id=\"unique_id\" value=\"21_book_3975774\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_id\" id=\"book_id\" value=\"3975774\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"a\" id=\"a\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_choice\" id=\"from_choice\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_home_module\" id=\"from_home_module\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_origin\" id=\"book_origin\" value=\"related_works\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_referrer\" id=\"page_referrer\" value=\"https://www.google.com/\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_url\" id=\"page_url\" value=\"/book/show/6339664-hush-hush\" />\n<\/form>\n\n<button class=\'wtrShelfButton\'><\/button>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'ratingStars wtrRating\'>\n<div class=\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\'>\nError rating book.

So when she spots a deer in the forest being pursued by a wolf, she cannot resist fighting it for the flesh. But to do so, she must kill the predator and killing something so precious comes at a price ...\n\nDragged to a magical kingdom for the murder of a faerie, Feyre discovers that her captor, his face obscured by a jewelled mask, is hiding far more than his piercing green eyes would suggest. Feyre\'s presence at the court is closely guarded, and as she begins to learn why, her feelings for him turn from hostility to passion and the faerie lands become an even more dangerous place. Feyre must fight to break an ancient curse, or she will lose him forever.<\/span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"16927393099092024071\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent(\$(this));; return false;\">...more<\/a>\n\n    <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\' id=\'22_book_16096824\'>\n<div class=\'wtrUp wtrLeft\'>\n<form action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" method=\"post\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"MUZ5rYDc6MO5gTQ3oqawOYU5NXvlUdUnFMRsRRAoVkrtRSvy4ISX16B8S/1NjBVyGnNdy/+FfpVP0qRGVlaKnQ==\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_id\" id=\"book_id\" value=\"16096824\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\" value=\"to-read\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"unique_id\" id=\"unique_id\" value=\"22_book_16096824\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"wtr_new\" id=\"wtr_new\" value=\"true\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_choice\" id=\"from_choice\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_home_module\" id=\"from_home_module\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"ref\" id=\"ref\" value=\"\" class=\"wtrLeftUpRef\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"existing_review\" id=\"existing_review\" value=\"false\" class=\"wtrExisting\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_origin\" id=\"book_origin\" value=\"related_works\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_referrer\" id=\"page_referrer\" value=\"https://www.google.com/\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_url\" id=\"page_url\" value=\"/book/show/6339664-hush-hush\" />\n<button class=\'wtrToRead\' type=\'submit\'>\n<span class=\'progressTrigger\'>Want to Read<\/span>\n<span class=\'progressIndicator\'>saving…<\/span>\n<\/button>\n<\/form>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'wtrRight wtrUp\'>\n<form class=\"hiddenShelfForm\" action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" method=\"post\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"FX2oKVamNf3p/O6Yy99S4hoGaZCTIXL4Hxaqrpi6LVTJfvp2Nv5K6fABkVIk9fephUwBIIn12UpEAGKt3sTxgw==\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"unique_id\" id=\"unique_id\" value=\"22_book_16096824\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_id\" id=\"book_id\" value=\"16096824\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"a\" id=\"a\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_choice\" id=\"from_choice\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_home_module\" id=\"from_home_module\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_origin\" id=\"book_origin\" value=\"related_works\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_referrer\" id=\"page_referrer\" value=\"https://www.google.com/\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_url\" id=\"page_url\" value=\"/book/show/6339664-hush-hush\" />\n<\/form>\n\n<button class=\'wtrShelfButton\'><\/button>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'ratingStars wtrRating\'>\n<div class=\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\'>\nError rating book.

La impotencia de no poder darle la justicia que se merece mi familia y todas las otras familias que han sido victimas me carcome por dentro y me duele cada día. \n\nPero no me voy a dar por vencida, lo voy a recordar, lo voy atrapar asi pierda mi vida en el intento.<\/span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"14245030759138982134\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent(\$(this));; return false;\">...more<\/a>\n\n    <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\' id=\'23_book_39668809\'>\n<div class=\'wtrUp wtrLeft\'>\n<form action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" method=\"post\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"jEWY0uRNt7NRp+mEuCEbv7wKgY7f3GrL+thGtXJ3QgpQRsqNhBXIp0halk5XC770I0DpPsUIwXmhzo62NAme3Q==\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_id\" id=\"book_id\" value=\"39668809\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\" value=\"to-read\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"unique_id\" id=\"unique_id\" value=\"23_book_39668809\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"wtr_new\" id=\"wtr_new\" value=\"true\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_choice\" id=\"from_choice\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_home_module\" id=\"from_home_module\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"ref\" id=\"ref\" value=\"\" class=\"wtrLeftUpRef\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"existing_review\" id=\"existing_review\" value=\"false\" class=\"wtrExisting\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_origin\" id=\"book_origin\" value=\"related_works\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_referrer\" id=\"page_referrer\" value=\"https://www.google.com/\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_url\" id=\"page_url\" value=\"/book/show/6339664-hush-hush\" />\n<button class=\'wtrToRead\' type=\'submit\'>\n<span class=\'progressTrigger\'>Want to Read<\/span>\n<span class=\'progressIndicator\'>saving…<\/span>\n<\/button>\n<\/form>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'wtrRight wtrUp\'>\n<form class=\"hiddenShelfForm\" action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" method=\"post\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"WKaF4dAUDYRI71s5+PGtj4tq/RaT2t9BluC7r6gkT8qEpde+sExykFESJPMX2wjEFCCVpokOdPPN9nOs7lqTHQ==\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"unique_id\" id=\"unique_id\" value=\"23_book_39668809\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_id\" id=\"book_id\" value=\"39668809\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"a\" id=\"a\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_choice\" id=\"from_choice\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_home_module\" id=\"from_home_module\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_origin\" id=\"book_origin\" value=\"related_works\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_referrer\" id=\"page_referrer\" value=\"https://www.google.com/\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_url\" id=\"page_url\" value=\"/book/show/6339664-hush-hush\" />\n<\/form>\n\n<button class=\'wtrShelfButton\'><\/button>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'ratingStars wtrRating\'>\n<div class=\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\'>\nError rating book.

But what\'s normal when you\'re a demon-slaying Shadowhunter, your mother is in a magically induced coma, and you can suddenly see Downworlders like werewolves, vampires, and faeries? If Clary left the world of the Shadowhunters behind, it would mean more time with her best friend, Simon, who\'s becoming more than a friend. But the Shadowhunting world isn\'t ready to let her go — especially her handsome, infuriating, newfound brother, Jace. And Clary\'s only chance to help her mother is to track down rogue Shadowhunter Valentine, who is probably insane, certainly evil — and also her father.\n\nTo complicate matters, someone in New York City is murdering Downworlder children. Is Valentine behind the killings — and if he is, what is he trying to do?

Surviving an attempt on her life wasn\'t pleasant, but at least she got a guardian angel out of it. A mysterious, magnetic, gorgeous guardian angel. But despite his role in her life, Patch has been acting anything but angelic. He\'s more elusive than ever (if that\'s possible) and what\'s worse, he seems to be spending time with Nora\'s archenemy, Marcie Millar.\n\nNora would have hardly noticed Scott Parnell, an old family friend who has moved back to town, if Patch hadn\'t been acting so distant. Even with Scott\'s totally infuriating attitude, Nora finds herself drawn to him - despite her lingering feelings that he is hiding something.\n\nIf that weren\'t enough, Nora is haunted by images of her murdered father, and comes to question whether her Nephilim bloodline has anything to do with his death. Desperate to figure out what happened, she puts herself in increasingly dangerous situations to get the answer. But maybe some things are better left buried, because the truth could destroy everything - and everyone - she trusts.<\/span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"6739787335597673396\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent(\$(this));; return false;\">...more<\/a>\n\n    <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\' id=\'26_book_7791997\'>\n<div class=\'wtrUp wtrLeft\'>\n<form action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" method=\"post\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"F09ekqKRFem8aWsIvoqiCh8Sb7b9I2/I1lDiiH0n7XzLTAzNwslq/aWUFMJRoAdBgFgHBuf3xHqNRiqLO1kxqw==\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_id\" id=\"book_id\" value=\"7791997\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\" value=\"to-read\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"unique_id\" id=\"unique_id\" value=\"26_book_7791997\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"wtr_new\" id=\"wtr_new\" value=\"true\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_choice\" id=\"from_choice\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_home_module\" id=\"from_home_module\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"ref\" id=\"ref\" value=\"\" class=\"wtrLeftUpRef\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"existing_review\" id=\"existing_review\" value=\"false\" class=\"wtrExisting\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_origin\" id=\"book_origin\" value=\"series_works\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_referrer\" id=\"page_referrer\" value=\"https://www.google.com/\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_url\" id=\"page_url\" value=\"/book/show/6339664-hush-hush\" />\n<button class=\'wtrToRead\' type=\'submit\'>\n<span class=\'progressTrigger\'>Want to Read<\/span>\n<span class=\'progressIndicator\'>saving…<\/span>\n<\/button>\n<\/form>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'wtrRight wtrUp\'>\n<form class=\"hiddenShelfForm\" action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" method=\"post\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"3lcdLhjF22vrARc6i5P5F1seHFV6aM/BIQCElRZfGP0CVE9xeJ2kf/L8aPBkuVxcxFR05WC8ZHN6FkyWUCHEKg==\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"unique_id\" id=\"unique_id\" value=\"26_book_7791997\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_id\" id=\"book_id\" value=\"7791997\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"a\" id=\"a\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_choice\" id=\"from_choice\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_home_module\" id=\"from_home_module\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_origin\" id=\"book_origin\" value=\"series_works\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_referrer\" id=\"page_referrer\" value=\"https://www.google.com/\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_url\" id=\"page_url\" value=\"/book/show/6339664-hush-hush\" />\n<\/form>\n\n<button class=\'wtrShelfButton\'><\/button>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'ratingStars wtrRating\'>\n<div class=\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\'>\nError rating book.

After the initial shock of waking up in a cemetery and being told that she has been missing for weeks - with no one knowing where she was or who she was with - she tried to get her life back on track. Go to school, hang out with her best friend, Vee, and dodge mom\'s creepy new boyfriend.\n\nBut there is this voice in the back of her head, an idea that she can almost reach out and touch. Visions of angel wings and unearthly creatures that have nothing to do with the life she knows.\n\nAnd this unshakable feeling that a part of her is missing.\n\nThen Nora crosses paths with a sexy stranger, whom she feels a mesmerizing connection to. He seems to hold all the answers...and her heart. Every minute she spends with him grows more and more intense until she realizes she could be falling in love.

Hank is gone and they should be able to put his ugly vendetta to rest. But in Hank\'s absence, Nora has become the unwitting head of the Nephilim and must finish what Hank began. Which ultimately means destroying the fallen angels - destroying Patch.\n\nNora will never let that happen, so she and Patch make a plan: lead everyone to believe they have broken up, and work the system from the inside. Nora will convince the Nephilim that they are making a mistake in fighting the fallen angels, and Patch will find out everything he can from the opposing side. They will end this war before it can even begin.\n\nBut the best-laid plans often go awry. Nora is put through the paces in her new role and finds herself drawn to an addictive power she never anticipated.\n\nAs the battle lines are drawn, Nora and Patch must confront the differences that have always been between them and either choose to ignore them or let them destroy the love they have always fought for.<\/span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"845597548724659619\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent(\$(this));; return false;\">...more<\/a>\n\n    <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\' id=\'28_book_12751687\'>\n<div class=\'wtrUp wtrLeft\'>\n<form action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" method=\"post\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"k3EIkPA2vkI3FdI4afSgn71LWlYZWU/cxH4b2oYTJaxPclrPkG7BVi7orfKG3gXUIgEy5gON5G6faNPZwG35ew==\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_id\" id=\"book_id\" value=\"12751687\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\" value=\"to-read\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"unique_id\" id=\"unique_id\" value=\"28_book_12751687\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"wtr_new\" id=\"wtr_new\" value=\"true\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_choice\" id=\"from_choice\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_home_module\" id=\"from_home_module\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"ref\" id=\"ref\" value=\"\" class=\"wtrLeftUpRef\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"existing_review\" id=\"existing_review\" value=\"false\" class=\"wtrExisting\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_origin\" id=\"book_origin\" value=\"series_works\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_referrer\" id=\"page_referrer\" value=\"https://www.google.com/\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_url\" id=\"page_url\" value=\"/book/show/6339664-hush-hush\" />\n<button class=\'wtrToRead\' type=\'submit\'>\n<span class=\'progressTrigger\'>Want to Read<\/span>\n<span class=\'progressIndicator\'>saving…<\/span>\n<\/button>\n<\/form>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'wtrRight wtrUp\'>\n<form class=\"hiddenShelfForm\" action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" method=\"post\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"D7X788bXVeVPsgeQEIQII+Ea67woZtFCqKctKbFv3F/Ttqmspo8q8VZPeFr/rq1oflCDDDKyevDzseUq9xEAiA==\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"unique_id\" id=\"unique_id\" value=\"28_book_12751687\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_id\" id=\"book_id\" value=\"12751687\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"a\" id=\"a\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_choice\" id=\"from_choice\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_home_module\" id=\"from_home_module\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_origin\" id=\"book_origin\" value=\"series_works\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_referrer\" id=\"page_referrer\" value=\"https://www.google.com/\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_url\" id=\"page_url\" value=\"/book/show/6339664-hush-hush\" />\n<\/form>\n\n<button class=\'wtrShelfButton\'><\/button>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'ratingStars wtrRating\'>\n<div class=\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\'>\nError rating book.

This partial loads on almost every page view.  The associated React component makes
a call to SignInPromptController#get to determine if the user should see the sign in interstial.
This is determined by how many signed out pagehits the user has executed an how recently they have
last seen the insterstitial.  If the controller responds indicating the popup should appear, the
React component will render its content.
